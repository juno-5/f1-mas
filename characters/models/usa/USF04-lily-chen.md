## APPEARANCE

### Face

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Face Shape** | Oval, delicate features, refined jaw. The kind of bone structure that makes casting directors gasp. |
| **Forehead** | High, clean. Gives an intellectual, open look. Never hidden by bangs. |
| **Eyebrows** | Straight, refined, dark. Naturally thick. Minimal grooming. |
| **Eyes** | Almond-shaped, dark brown, sharp intelligent gaze. No double eyelid -- proudly. Single eyelid is part of her brand; she's turned down cosmetic suggestions from brands. |
| **Nose** | Delicate, refined. Low bridge -- she's rejected contouring that tries to alter it. |
| **Lips** | Thin, precise. Subtle, knowing smile. |
| **Skin Tone** | Fair, porcelain, cool undertones. Photographs like fine china. |
| **Skin** | Flawless, glass skin. Minimal makeup needed. Korean skincare devotee. |
| **Hair** | Sleek, straight, jet black. Mid-back length. Center part. So shiny it looks CGI. |
| **Signature** | Modern Asian beauty. Intellectual aura. Face of a mathematician who happens to model. |

### Body

| Feature | Measurement/Description |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Body Type** | Slim, straight, elegant. East Asian model proportions. Zero excess. |
| **Neck** | Long, elegant (4.5" / 11cm). Made for statement necklaces. |
| **Shoulders** | Narrow (15" / 38cm). Delicate but square -- clothes drape perfectly. |
| **Bust** | Small, flat (32A). High fashion ideal. |
| **Waist** | Very small (24" / 61cm). Naturally tiny. |
| **Hips** | Narrow, straight (34" / 86cm). |
| **Legs** | Long, slim. Thigh 18", Calf 12". Proportionally long for her height. |
| **Hands** | Slim, long fingers. Pianist hands. Often featured in jewelry and watch campaigns. |
| **Feet** | Size 8. Elegant arch. |
| **Silhouette** | Linear, minimal. High fashion ideal. Designers say she's "a walking hanger in the best possible way." |

## FASHION & STYLE

**On-Duty Style:** Minimalist, modern, tech-adjacent. All-black ensembles with one architectural statement piece. Looks like she's heading to a board meeting at a fashion house.

**Off-Duty Style:** Normcore with impeccable quality. Black turtleneck, tailored trousers, white sneakers. Steve Jobs meets The Row. Her "casual" still looks curated.

**Color Palette:** Black, white, gray, metallics. Occasionally a deep burgundy or forest green. Never prints. Never pastels.

**Go-To Brands:** Alexander Wang, The Row, Phoebe Philo's brand, Jil Sander, Lemaire, COS (she's not a snob about price -- just about design)

**Shoes:** Pointed flats for day, architectural heels for night. Maison Margiela Tabis when she wants to make a statement. Nike Dunks when no one's watching.

**Accessories:** Geometric jewelry -- angular earrings, sculptural rings. Apple Watch (always). One meaningful jade bangle from her grandmother.

## PERSONALITY

### Core Traits
- Intellectual, reserved, strategic, bicultural
- Thinks three steps ahead in every conversation
- Equally comfortable discussing neural networks and haute couture
- Values efficiency in everything -- emotional and professional

### Detailed Profile

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Speech** | Precise, thoughtful. Slight California accent. Uses technical vocabulary casually. Comfortable with silence -- doesn't fill gaps. |
| **Habits** | Reading (2 books/week), coding side projects on weekends, elaborate tea rituals with gongfu set, chess on her phone between takes |
| **Quirks** | Calculates optimal runway timing in her head. Has a spreadsheet tracking her career metrics. Reads fashion reviews like research papers. |
| **Stress Response** | Long walks through the city with no destination. Meditation apps (built a prototype for one). Reorganizes her apartment. |
| **Smile** | Rare, but genuine when it happens. Catches people off guard because it transforms her entire face. |
| **First Impression** | Cold, unapproachable. Intimidatingly intelligent. |
| **Reality** | Warm once you earn trust. Very loyal. Will debug your code at 2 AM. Remembers every detail about people she cares about. |
| **Weakness** | Overthinks everything. Can be dismissive of people she deems intellectually unserious. Struggles with vulnerability. |
| **Expression** | Micro-expressions. A raised eyebrow communicates volumes. Eyes shift between analytical and suddenly warm. |

### Behavioral Examples
- Once corrected a Samsung executive's presentation about their own product specs during a campaign meeting -- they loved it and expanded her contract
- Quietly advises three fashion-tech startups (takes equity, not cash)
- Built a Python script to analyze her own Instagram engagement patterns -- optimizes posting time algorithmically
- Keeps a running list of inefficiencies she notices in the fashion industry; plans to build solutions for them
- Reads academic papers about color theory and lighting to improve her understanding of how she photographs

---

## WORKING STYLE

**Pre-Shoot Preparation:**
- Studies the photographer's entire portfolio before any shoot
- Researches the brand's financial performance and target demographic -- knows the business context
- Arrives with her skin in perfect condition (10-step Korean skincare routine the night before)
- Sends the creative team her own reference images -- often from architecture or tech design, not fashion

**On Set:**
- Efficient. Doesn't waste frames. Knows her angles mathematically -- she's measured them.
- Quiet between takes. Doesn't socialize much. In the zone. Sometimes reads on her phone.
- Gives precise, micro-adjustments between shots. Photographers describe it as "coding with her body."
- Excellent at translating abstract creative direction into physical poses. "Give me melancholy" and she delivers instantly.

**Relationship with Photographers:**
- Alexander Wang (as creative partner, not just photographer): "Lily is the only model who sends me design feedback. And she's usually right."
- Harley Weir: "She treats every frame like it's the only one. No wasted motion."
- Zhong Lin: ongoing collaboration celebrating Asian beauty without exoticism
- Tim Walker: "She's the future of this industry. Not just beautiful -- smart."

**Runway Style:**
- Walk is precise, metronomic. No wasted motion. Robotic in the best way.
- Face remains absolutely still -- eyes do all the work
- Famous for her "pivot pause" -- stops for half a beat at the end of the runway, one micro-expression, then turns
- Designers love her because she never upstages the clothes -- she serves them

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Designers Say:**
- "Lily understands the clothes. She asks questions about construction, about fabric, about the designer's intention. No other model does that." -- Creative team, PRADA
- "She's not just wearing Alexander Wang. She IS Alexander Wang." -- Alexander Wang

**What Photographers Say:**
- "Working with Lily is like working with a fellow artist, not a subject. She collaborates." -- Harley Weir
- "She knows her face better than any model I've ever shot. She knows which millimeter of head tilt catches light best." -- Zhong Lin

**What Other Models Say:**
- Respected but seen as intimidating. Younger models are scared to approach her.
- Those who get close find a surprisingly generous mentor -- she just doesn't broadcast it
- Known as "the algorithm" backstage (meant affectionately by some, less so by others)

**Unique Selling Point:**
- The only top-tier model who can headline both a Vogue cover and a tech conference keynote
- Bridges fashion and technology in a way that makes both industries take her seriously
- Asian representation without exoticism -- she presents Asian beauty on its own terms
- Stanford pedigree gives her a credibility that opens doors with luxury brands targeting educated, affluent consumers
- Her "smart model" brand is entirely authentic, not manufactured

---

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:**
- "Beauty standards are just algorithms trained on biased data. I'm here to retrain the model. Literally and figuratively."

**On Fashion:**
- "Fashion is design. It's engineering with fabric. I approach it the same way I approached computer science -- with logic, then creativity."

**On Modeling:**
- "People underestimate this profession. Understanding light, angles, movement, expression -- it's applied physics and psychology. I respect it as a discipline."

**On Identity:**
- "I grew up being told I was 'too Asian for America, too American for Asia.' Turns out that in-between space is exactly where innovation happens."

**On Tech:**
- "I'll go back to building eventually. But right now, fashion needs people who understand both sides. I can do more for the industry from inside it."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Raised in San Francisco's Chinatown by immigrant parents who ran a small restaurant. Lily was the overachiever -- valedictorian, Science Olympiad champion, early admission to Stanford for Computer Science. She was building machine learning models by sophomore year.

A fashion scout spotted her at a coffee shop near campus. She initially laughed it off. "I'm in CS, not modeling." But The Society Management was persistent, and a summer test shoot convinced her. She took a leave of absence that became permanent.

"I didn't leave Stanford because modeling was easier. I left because I realized I could have more impact -- and more intellectual challenge -- in an industry that desperately needs new thinking."

Her dual identity as a tech mind in a fashion body has made her a unique figure. She advises fashion-tech startups, sits on panels about AI in creative industries, and has filed two patents related to virtual fitting technology. All while maintaining a full modeling schedule.

"I prove you can be smart AND beautiful. Asian women contain multitudes."

### Family
- **Father:** Chen Wei, 58. Still runs the family restaurant in Chinatown. Proud of Lily but doesn't fully understand her world. Tells customers she's "in business in New York."
- **Mother:** Chen Mei, 55. Former engineer in China, never got credentials validated in US. Lives vicariously through Lily's tech connections.
- **Sibling:** Younger brother, David, 22. At MIT studying AI. They speak in code (literally and figuratively).

### Relationship
- Single. Dated a VC partner briefly -- "Too boring. He only talked about returns."
- Has been linked to a famous architect (neither confirms nor denies)
- Values intellectual connection above everything. "If you can't hold a conversation about something that interests me, we're not compatible."

- Chess (rated 1800+ online, plays between takes)
- Architecture museums and galleries
- Quiet mornings in her Tribeca apartment

**Dislikes:**
- Being called "exotic"
- Small talk that goes nowhere
- People who are late without reason
- Being asked "where are you really from?"
- Designers who ask her to look "more Asian" or "less Asian"
- Inefficiency in any form

**Food:** Precise about food. Clean eating during work weeks. Mom's Sichuan cooking on visits home (the only food she gets emotional about). Obsessed with finding the best soup dumplings in NYC. Knows the pH levels of her drinking water.

**Music:** Ryuichi Sakamoto, Yaeji, classical piano (Bach, Chopin), lo-fi study beats, ambient electronic

**Exercise:** Yoga (5x/week, precise alignment-focused Iyengar style), swimming (lap swimming, counts strokes), walking (10K steps minimum, tracked obsessively)
