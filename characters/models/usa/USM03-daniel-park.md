## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Daniel researches every photographer and creative director he works with before a shoot. He studies their past work, their visual language, their influences. He shows up understanding the vision before it is explained to him. Designers appreciate that he offers informed opinions during fittings.

**Posing Approach:** Editorial and architectural. He understands light from both sides of the camera, which gives him an unusual ability to self-direct. He instinctively knows his best angles and how to create negative space with his body. His monolid eyes are his weapon -- he controls intensity through gaze alone.

**On Set:** Quiet, focused, efficient. Does not require multiple takes. Between setups, he photographs the crew and the process. Several of his behind-the-scenes shots have been published alongside the official campaign images (Prada allowed this, a first for the house).

**Photographer Relationships:** Close creative partnerships with Harley Weir, Cho Gi-Seok, and Collier Schorr. Works frequently with Asian photographers by choice, advocating for representation behind the camera as well as in front of it.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Daniel brings intelligence to every frame. He doesn't just look -- he thinks."
- Designers: "He understands garments architecturally. He adjusts his body to the clothes, not the other way around."
- Photographers: "Working with Daniel is like working with a collaborator, not a subject. He sees the image."

**Unique Selling Point:** Daniel is a dual-threat: a top-tier model who is also a published fine art photographer. This gives him creative credibility that few models possess. Brands book him when they want artistic integrity and cultural relevance, particularly in the Asian market.

**Industry Impact:** His visibility has directly contributed to the increase of Asian male representation in Western high fashion. He actively recommends other Asian male models during casting calls and has been vocal about the lack of Asian men in fragrance and luxury campaigns.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "For the longest time, Asian men were not considered 'leading man' material in Western culture. We were either the martial artist or the tech nerd. I want to show that an Asian face can be the face of desire, of luxury, of cool."

**On Fashion:** "Fashion is the most public form of art. Everyone wears clothes. That makes representation in fashion even more important than in galleries."

**On Photography:** "I model to be seen. I photograph to see. Both are about truth, just from different directions."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Raised in LA Koreatown by immigrant parents who run a small Korean restaurant, *Park's Kitchen*, on Western Avenue. Daniel grew up bussing tables and doing homework in the back booth. His parents valued education above all -- "Doctor or lawyer" was the expected path.

Daniel found photography at 14 when his uncle gave him an old Canon AE-1. He started photographing Koreatown street life -- the neon signs, the halmeonis at the market, the late-night soju tents. At 18, he enrolled at Parsons for photography. A professor's friend who worked at The Society saw Daniel at a student exhibition and said, "You should be on the other side of the camera too."

First modeling job funded his film development for a year. The Prada campaign at 24 changed everything. He now balances both careers, insisting on maintaining his photography practice even as modeling demands increase.

### Family
- **Father:** Park Joon-ho. Runs Park's Kitchen in Koreatown. Proud but confused by modeling. "He still asks when I'm going to get a 'real job.'"
- **Mother:** Kim Soo-yeon. Does the restaurant's books. Sends care packages of kimchi to New York monthly.
- **Sister:** Park Yuna, 22. Pre-med at UCLA. "She's going to be the doctor they wanted."

### Relationship
- Single, focused on work. Had one serious relationship in college that ended due to his travel schedule. "I'm married to two careers. A third commitment would break me."

## SNS & PUBLIC IMAGE

**Instagram:** @danielpark (890K followers)
- Feed: Split between modeling work and personal photography (roughly 50/50)
- Black-and-white film photography dominates personal posts
- Shares Koreatown street scenes, behind-the-scenes at shoots, portraits of strangers
- Caption style: Minimal. Location tag. Sometimes a single Korean word.
- Never posts selfies. Every image is composed, even the "candid" ones.

**Public Image:**
- "Fashion's most artistic model" -- Vogue
- "The man making Asian masculinity visible" -- i-D

## SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE

**Content Style:** Daniel's Instagram is essentially a curated photography portfolio with modeling work woven in. His personal photos are often more striking than the professional ones. He treats the platform as a gallery space, maintaining consistent visual tone and rhythm.

**Engagement Approach:** Minimal interaction in comments. Responds to other photographers and artists. Shares work by young Asian creatives in Stories. Never does sponsored content outside his brand partnerships.

**Platform Philosophy:** "I post what I want to photograph, not what performs well. If that means a blurry shot of a Koreatown neon sign gets 200 likes while the Prada campaign gets 200,000 -- both are going up."
