## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Aisha prepares with intention and prayer. She reviews campaign concepts for cultural sensitivity, ensures that hijab will be styled respectfully (not as costume), and communicates her boundaries clearly and early. She brings her own hijab collection to shoots, color-coordinated to the wardrobe, because she understands hijab styling better than any external stylist.

**Posing Approach:** Aisha has developed a visual language within modest parameters that is uniquely compelling. Without hair, bare shoulders, or body-revealing poses, she communicates entirely through her eyes, hands, and the draping of fabric. This constraint has made her more creative, not less. Photographers describe her images as "intimate despite the coverage."

**On Set:** Quiet, dignified, professional. She takes prayer breaks (communicated in advance, always respected). She educates styling teams on hijab pinning techniques and modest silhouette construction. She never compromises on her boundaries but does so with grace that prevents conflict. Crew members describe her as "the most peaceful person to work with."

**Photographer Relationships:** Close working relationships with Muslim and Middle Eastern photographers (Alaa Balkhy, Yelena Yemchuk) and mainstream collaborators who respect her boundaries (Steven Meisel, Tyler Mitchell). She has built a roster of photographers who understand modest fashion photography.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Aisha opened a door that didn't exist. She created a category and became its standard-bearer."
- Designers: "Working with Aisha teaches you that limitation breeds creativity. She makes modest fashion look like the most exciting thing in the industry."
- Fellow models: "She never compromises. And she does it with such grace that you don't even realize she's drawn a line."

**Unique Selling Point:** Aisha is the premier modest fashion model in the Western industry, with business acumen (her own line) to match her modeling career. She represents a $300 billion global modest fashion market that the industry has historically ignored. Brands book her for access to this market with authentic credibility.

**Industry Impact:** Since Aisha's Estee Lauder campaign, five major beauty brands have created hijab-inclusive campaigns. Her "Noor by Aisha" line at Nordstrom was the first hijabi-designed modest fashion brand carried by a major US department store. She has consulted with 10+ brands on modest fashion strategy.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "Beauty in Islam is about noor -- divine light. When I cover my body and show my face, I am not hiding. I am choosing what to illuminate. My hijab is not a limitation. It is a spotlight on my soul."

**On Fashion:** "For too long, modest fashion was invisible in the Western industry. Muslim women spend billions on fashion. We deserve to be designed for, marketed to, and represented. I'm not asking for a seat at the table. I built my own table."

**On Representation:** "I wanted little Muslim girls to see themselves in magazines. Now they do. But I want more than visibility. I want normalization. I want a hijabi model in a campaign to be unremarkable. We're not there yet."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Raised in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis, the heart of the Somali-American community. Her parents are Somali refugees who arrived in Minnesota in the 1990s. Her father drives a taxi; her mother is a community organizer. Aisha grew up between two worlds -- American school and Somali home -- with Islam as the constant.

She loved fashion from childhood but saw no one who looked like her in magazines. At Parsons, she focused her thesis on modest fashion design, creating a capsule collection that caught the attention of a Select Models scout at her senior show. Her first editorial, wearing hijab, was for Paper Magazine and went viral.

The Nike Pro Hijab campaign at 22 made her a public figure. The Estee Lauder campaign at 23 was historic. She launched "Noor by Aisha" at 24 with her own savings, determination, and a lot of prayer. The line, carried at Nordstrom, is profitable in its first year.

### Family
- **Father:** Ibrahim Abdi. Taxi driver. Proud but private. "Baba doesn't want fame. He wants safety, stability, and for his children to be good Muslims. I try to give him all three."
- **Mother:** Halima Ibrahim. Community organizer. "Hoyo is the strongest woman I know. She organized the Somali community in Minneapolis from nothing. My entrepreneurship is from her."
- **Brother:** Hassan Ibrahim, 29. IT professional. Protective older brother.
- **Sisters:** Fatima (23) and Yasmin (19). Fatima works at the mosque school. Yasmin studies engineering.
- Large Somali extended family in Minneapolis.

### Relationship
- Married to tech entrepreneur Abdi Mohamed (Islamic wedding, 2 years). They met through family introduction. "Our marriage is traditional and modern. We were introduced by family, but we chose each other. He supports my career completely."
