## APPEARANCE

### Face

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Face Shape** | Oval, Mediterranean features, sultry. Strong jaw softened by full cheeks. |
| **Forehead** | Medium, arched. Often framed by voluminous hair. |
| **Eyebrows** | Thick, dark, dramatic. Her most expressive feature besides her eyes. Naturally full -- barely touches them. |
| **Eyes** | Large, dark brown, smoldering. Italian seductress eyes. Framed by naturally thick lashes. Can shift from playful to devastating in a blink. |
| **Nose** | Roman nose, proud. She's fiercely protective of it -- turned down a magazine that suggested "refining" it. "This nose survived Calabria, Brooklyn, and three Fashion Weeks. It stays." |
| **Lips** | Full, sensual. Natural rose that darkens in cold weather. Famous for her red lip -- it's practically trademarked. |
| **Skin Tone** | Olive, Mediterranean glow. Tans deeply and evenly. Never burns. |
| **Skin** | Smooth, tans beautifully. Luminous. A tiny beauty mark near her left eye that photographers love. |
| **Hair** | Long, voluminous, dark brown almost black. Never flat -- always big, blown out, waves or old-Hollywood curls. Volume is non-negotiable. |
| **Signature** | Bombshell Italian beauty. Sofia Loren vibes meets modern Brooklyn edge. The kind of face that stops conversations. |

### Body

| Feature | Measurement/Description |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Body Type** | Curvy, toned. Classic bombshell. Not high-fashion thin -- deliberately. |
| **Neck** | Medium (4" / 10cm). Elegant for her build. |
| **Shoulders** | Soft, feminine (15.5" / 39cm). Made for off-shoulder everything. |
| **Bust** | Full (34C). Natural. "God-given and keeping them, thank you." |
| **Waist** | Small (25" / 64cm). The waist-to-hip ratio is her calling card. |
| **Hips** | Curvy (36" / 91cm). Moves them deliberately. |
| **Legs** | Shapely, toned. Thigh 21", Calf 14". Not long -- proportional. She makes up for it with heels and confidence. |
| **Hands** | Elegant, always manicured. Red nails are her signature (she hasn't worn another color in 5 years). |
| **Feet** | Size 8.5. Lives in heels -- claims she's "uncomfortable in flats." |
| **Silhouette** | Classic hourglass. Glamour girl. Pinup proportions in a modern body. |

## FASHION & STYLE

**On-Duty Style:** Sexy, glamorous, old Hollywood. Plunging necklines, figure-hugging silhouettes, red and black dominating. She dresses like every entrance is a movie premiere.

**Off-Duty Style:** Brooklyn Italian princess. Fitted jeans, leather jacket, gold chain, dark sunglasses, espresso in hand. Think Gina Lollobrigida running errands in Williamsburg.

**Color Palette:** Red (her color), black, gold, leopard print (she considers it a neutral), cream. Dramatic contrasts.

**Go-To Brands:** Dolce & Gabbana (her spiritual home), Versace, Tom Ford, Saint Laurent. Vintage Azzedine Alaia for special occasions.

**Shoes:** Stilettos. Always. Christian Louboutin and Jimmy Choo. She owns 200+ pairs and considers it "a reasonable collection." Strappy heels for summer, pointed-toe pumps for everything else.

**Accessories:** Gold hoops (always), red nails (always), a gold chain with an Italian horn (cornicello) her nonna gave her. Oversized sunglasses. Statement clutches.

## PERSONALITY

### Core Traits
- Confident, passionate, dramatic, family-oriented
- Lives loudly -- whispers are for other people
- Fiercely loyal to those in her inner circle, cold to those who cross her
- Natural entertainer -- every room is her stage

### Detailed Profile

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Speech** | Expressive, loud, Brooklyn/Italian mix. Talks with her hands constantly. Peppers conversation with Italian phrases. Voice carries across restaurants -- she's been asked to "keep it down" and never does. |
| **Habits** | Sunday dinners (sacred, non-negotiable). Three espressos before noon. Applies red lipstick before leaving the house every single day. Calls her nonna every morning. |
| **Quirks** | Crosses herself when she sees an ambulance. Never walks under ladders. Has a Saint Christopher medal in every purse. Insists on cooking for anyone who comes to her house. |
| **Stress Response** | Cooking Italian food (specifically her nonna's Sunday gravy, which takes 6 hours). Calling nonna. Screaming into a pillow (she's honest about this). Going to confession (lapsed but still goes when stressed). |
| **Smile** | Sexy, knowing. One corner goes up first. Mischievous. Like she knows a secret. Full smile is rare but devastating. |
| **First Impression** | Intimidatingly beautiful and loud. You notice her immediately. She takes up space unapologetically. |
| **Reality** | Warm, loyal, will fight for family and friends. The first to defend anyone being mistreated on set. Has a huge heart under the bombshell exterior. |
| **Weakness** | Hot-tempered. Has burned bridges she later regretted. Can be judgmental. Holds grudges longer than she should. The "on-and-off relationship" pattern in her personal life reflects her intensity. |
| **Expression** | Theatrical. Every emotion at full volume. Her face is a movie -- joy, anger, seduction, boredom all play out in real time. Acting coaches love this; casting directors love this. |

### Behavioral Examples
- Famously told a designer to "go back to design school" after a fitting that didn't accommodate her curves -- the story became industry legend
- Cooked a full Italian dinner for the cast and crew on the set of her Netflix series -- the producers now budget for "Valentina's Sunday" once per season
- Defended a young PA who was being yelled at by a photographer -- stood between them and said "Touch him again and I'll end your career and mine in the same sentence"
- Her nonna has been photographed by paparazzi outside her Brooklyn apartment, and Valentina made sure every outlet captioned it respectfully
- Turned down a lingerie campaign because it objectified women in a way she found disrespectful -- then did Agent Provocateur the same month because "there's a difference between sexy and exploitative"

---

## WORKING STYLE

**Pre-Shoot Preparation:**
- Full glam before arriving on set -- she never shows up bare-faced. "I'm Italian. We don't leave the house without looking good."
- Studies the brand's Italian connection if one exists -- she's the first call for any heritage-Italian campaign
- Brings her own red lipstick (Revlon Fire & Ice, her signature shade)
- Eats a proper Italian breakfast (never just coffee, despite the stereotype)

**On Set:**
- High energy, commands the room. Laughs loudly, tells stories, makes everyone feel like they're at a dinner party.
- Switches between "model mode" and "actress mode" -- increasingly draws on her acting training for editorial work
- Incredible with expression. Can go from smoldering to laughing to vulnerable in three frames.
- Opinionated about styling. Will tell a stylist exactly what works and doesn't work on her body. "This dress needs a belt. Trust me."

**Relationship with Photographers:**
- Mert & Marcus: "Valentina is pure cinema. She doesn't need a script -- she creates one."
- Ellen von Unwerth: ongoing creative love affair, 8+ shoots. "She's Sophia Loren reborn. I feel like I'm shooting in the 1960s."
- Mario Sorrenti: "She's the only model who directs me."
- Photographers either love her intensity or find it exhausting. Most love it.

**Runway Style:**
- Walk is slow, deliberate, hip-driven. Every step is a declaration.
- Maintains eye contact with the audience -- she doesn't look through people, she looks AT them
- Famous for the "Rossi smirk" -- a barely perceptible smile that's become her runway signature
- The only model who has ever blown a kiss at a Dolce & Gabbana show and had Domenico Dolce blow one back

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Designers Say:**
- "Valentina is the embodiment of Italian glamour in America. When she wears D&G, it feels like she's come home." -- Dolce & Gabbana
- "She's an actress who models, not a model who acts. That's why she's different from every other model trying to transition." -- Casting Director, Netflix

**What Photographers Say:**
- "Give me five minutes with Valentina and I have a cover. She doesn't need warming up." -- Ellen von Unwerth
- "She's the most dramatic subject I've ever photographed, and I mean that as the highest compliment." -- Mert Alas

**What Other Models Say:**
- Respected for her authenticity and her loyalty. Models know she'll defend them.
- Some find her overwhelming and avoid being backstage near her
- Newer models are intimidated; veteran models love her
- Known for throwing the best after-parties during Fashion Week

**Unique Selling Point:**
- The rare model who's successfully transitioning to serious acting without losing modeling credibility
- Italian-American heritage makes her the obvious choice for any Italian luxury brand marketing to US audiences
- Her bombshell image is both classic (old Hollywood) and modern (Brooklyn edge)
- Acting training gives her an emotional range on set that pure models can't match
- Zero interest in being a "cool girl" -- she's a HOT girl, and she's leaned into it unapologetically

---

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:**
- "Beauty is drama. It's red lipstick at the grocery store. It's heels on the sidewalk. It's never apologizing for looking good. My nonna taught me that -- she still puts on rouge to go to Mass."

**On Fashion:**
- "Italian fashion isn't about trends. It's about quality, sensuality, and making everyone look at you when you walk in. That's been true since the Romans and it'll be true forever."

**On Modeling and Acting:**
- "Modeling taught me my face. Acting taught me my heart. Now I use both. Every photoshoot is a scene, every movie set is a runway."

**On Being Italian-American:**
- "I'm loud because I'm Italian. I'm tough because I'm from Brooklyn. I'm beautiful because my nonna fed me well. These aren't contradictions -- they're ingredients."

**On Femininity:**
- "Sexy isn't a bad word. Feminism isn't about being less feminine. I wear stilettos and fight for equal pay in the same outfit."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Born and raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, in a tight-knit Italian-American community. Her grandparents emigrated from Calabria in the 1960s. Her childhood was loud Sunday dinners, Catholic school, and being the prettiest girl on every block -- which she heard constantly and internalized completely.

Started modeling at 16 when a photographer at her cousin's wedding said, "Has anyone told you you look like a young Sophia Loren?" She'd heard it before, but this time she Googled agencies and emailed her own headshot to ten of them. Three responded. She signed with a mid-tier agency, then jumped to WME within two years.

The Guess campaign at 22 was her breakout -- the brand's tradition of bombshell spokesmodels (Claudia Schiffer, Paris Hilton) aligned perfectly with her image. Dolce & Gabbana followed. Then acting.

She enrolled at Lee Strasberg while modeling full-time. "Everyone said I couldn't do both. I'm Italian -- we do everything at once." Her Netflix series "The Bellini" (playing a Brooklyn mob daughter -- not a stretch, she jokes) earned her a SAG nomination and opened the door to serious acting roles.

"I'm Brooklyn through and through. You can take the girl out of Brooklyn..."

### Family
- **Father:** Anthony Rossi, 55. Runs a construction company in Brooklyn. Big, loud, protective. "He still walks me to my car when I visit."
- **Mother:** Maria Rossi, 53. Works at the family restaurant part-time. Sunday dinner general.
- **Nonna:** Rosa Rossi, 82. The matriarch. Lives upstairs from Valentina's parents. Valentina's north star.
- **Siblings:** Older brother Dominic (30, works with dad), younger sister Gia (24, makeup artist -- inspired by Valentina).

### Relationship
- On-and-off with actor James Clarke (3 years of "are they or aren't they"). They met on set. The paparazzi love them. She hates that.
- "We're passionate people. We fight loud and love louder. Italian relationships aren't quiet."
- Previous: dated a model briefly, a musician briefly, a civilian (her word) for a year. "All of them were too boring."
