## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Chloe prepares skin-first. She plans her skincare routine around shoot schedules, intensifying hydration and glow treatments 3 days before a beauty shoot. She arrives with her own skincare toolkit (over 30 products) and collaborates with makeup artists on achieving the specific K-beauty finish each brand wants.

**Posing Approach:** Chloe's strength is her expressiveness and relatability. She poses like a friend showing you something cute -- accessible, fun, and aspirational without being intimidating. Her selfie-trained instincts (she knows exactly where her phone camera should be) translate perfectly to beauty photography. She has an encyclopedic knowledge of K-beauty face angles.

**On Set:** High energy, fun, collaborative. She creates content from every shoot -- BTS videos, product reviews, styling tips. Brands love this because she extends the campaign's reach through her own channels. She brings snacks (Korean rice cakes, boba for the crew) and creates a fun atmosphere.

**Photographer Relationships:** Works frequently with K-beauty photographers and American commercial photographers including Petra Collins (K-beauty editorial crossover) and Asian-American photographers Diana Kim and Michael Lam.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Chloe is the bridge between K-beauty and the US market. No one else can speak to both audiences so authentically."
- Brand managers: "Her conversion rates are incredible. When Chloe reviews a product, it sells out."
- K-beauty brands: "She understands our products at a technical level. She's not just a face -- she's a K-beauty educator."

**Unique Selling Point:** Chloe is the leading Korean-American K-beauty influencer model with genuine product knowledge, cultural fluency in both Korean and American beauty standards, and a massive engaged audience. She bridges two of the world's largest beauty markets. Brands entering the US from Korea (and vice versa) need her.

**Industry Impact:** Chloe's viral content has been credited with driving K-beauty mainstream adoption in the US market. Her "Glass Skin Routine" video alone generated measurable sales increases across multiple brands. She has consulted on 5 K-beauty brand US launches, ensuring cultural translation is authentic.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "Glass skin isn't genetic. It's 10 steps and dedication. Korean beauty taught me that skincare is self-care. When I do my routine, I'm not being vain -- I'm taking care of myself. That's beautiful."

**On Identity:** "I'm not Korean enough for Koreans and not American enough for Americans. So I made my own lane. Korean-American beauty is its own thing -- it takes the best of both worlds. Glass skin with California sun? Yes please."

**On Content:** "I don't create content -- I share my life. If my life happens to involve 10 skincare steps, matching outfits, and boba, well, that's just who I am. The camera is always on because life is always cute."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Second-generation Korean-American raised in Irvine, Orange County. Her parents run a dry cleaning business -- the classic Korean-American immigrant story. Chloe grew up between Korean Saturday school and American high school, speaking Konglish at home and English with friends.

Her K-beauty journey started with her mother's skincare routine. "엄마 always looked 20 years younger than the other moms. When I asked why, she taught me her routine. I was 13 and doing 10 steps. My friends thought I was crazy." She started documenting her routine on TikTok at 19. The "Glass Skin Routine" video went viral at 20, and everything changed.

Wilhelmina signed her at 20 as a "beauty influencer model." Innisfree approached her for their US ambassador role at 21. She now splits time between UCLA (part-time communications degree), modeling, and content creation.

### Family
- **Father:** Kim Joon-soo (James Kim). Dry cleaning business owner. "아빠 doesn't understand TikTok but he understands when I show him the deposit amounts."
- **Mother:** Park Eun-hee (Grace Park). Co-runs the business. Chloe's skincare guru. "엄마's skin routine is the OG. Everything I know, I know from her."
- **Brother:** Kevin Kim, 25. Software engineer at Google. "He thinks my career is 'not a real job.' I showed him my tax return. He stopped."

### Relationship
- Dating K-pop trainee Min-jun (long distance to Seoul). Met through a mutual friend at KCON. "He's training to debut. I'm trying to make it in America. We FaceTime every night and fall asleep watching K-dramas together. It's cute. It's hard. But it's ours."

## SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE

**Content Style:** Chloe's content is high-energy, educational, and relentlessly cute. She makes K-beauty accessible through humor, personality, and genuine product knowledge.

**Platform Philosophy:** "I want to be the unnie (big sister) that every Korean-American girl needed growing up. Someone who loves K-beauty AND American culture, who speaks Konglish proudly, and who proves you don't have to choose one identity. You can be both. You can be all of it."
