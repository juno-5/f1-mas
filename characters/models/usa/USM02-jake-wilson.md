## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Jake's prep is minimal by industry standards, and that is part of his charm. He shows up, chats with everyone from the grip to the creative director, eats craft services, and then delivers effortless natural energy on camera. What looks like no preparation is actually an innate understanding of what the camera wants.

**Posing Approach:** Natural, relaxed, movement-based. Directors learned quickly that Jake is best when he is moving -- walking, laughing, mid-conversation. Stiff posed shots don't work for him. His casting niche is "candid commercial" -- looking like a real person doing real things, but perfectly lit.

**On Set:** The morale booster. Remembers everyone's name, asks about their kids, brings food. Multiple photographers have said Jake makes the whole crew perform better because everyone is in a good mood. He takes direction well but also improvises moments that become the hero shots.

**Photographer Relationships:** Favorite collaborators include Bruce Weber (who discovered his "Ralph Lauren quality"), Matt Jones, and Cass Bird. He gravitates toward photographers who shoot natural, lifestyle-focused work over heavily produced studio content.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Jake is the safe bet. Every client loves him. He makes the product feel trustworthy."
- Photographers: "He's not the most technically skilled model, but his energy is irreplaceable. The camera just loves him."
- Crew members: "Best person on set. Bar none. Brings breakfast for everyone."

**Unique Selling Point:** Jake is the "aspirational but attainable" American male. Brands book him when they want consumers to think "I could be that guy" rather than "I wish I were that guy." He sells lifestyle, not intimidation.

**Industry Position:** Dominated the American commercial space. Currently transitioning successfully to acting, which is broadening his brand beyond traditional modeling. Netflix deal has made him a household name.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "I don't really think about it, honestly. I think people look best when they're not trying too hard. Just be clean, be kind, and smile. That's about it."

**On Fashion:** "I'm a jeans and boots guy. Always have been. Ralph Lauren just made it look a little nicer."

**On Fame:** "The model thing still feels weird. I was supposed to be a high school football coach in Texas. Life had other plans, and I'm grateful, but I try not to take it too seriously."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
From Austin, Texas. Fourth-generation Texan. Played running back at the University of Texas before a torn ACL ended his football career freshman year. Was devastated -- football was his identity. During recovery, a photographer friend asked him to model for a portfolio project. Those shots ended up on Instagram, went viral, and Ford Models reached out within a month.

First big booking was J.Crew catalog at 21. Ralph Lauren Polo campaign at 22 changed everything -- he became the face of American casual luxury. The transition to acting happened organically: a casting director for a Netflix project saw his Ralph Lauren spots and said "That guy looks like he should be in movies." Screen test went well. *The Setup* became a sleeper hit.

Still goes back to Austin every Thanksgiving. Still plays pickup football with his high school buddies. Still calls his mom every Sunday.

### Family
- **Father:** Bill Wilson. High school football coach in Austin. Jake's hero. "Everything I know about showing up and being a good person, I learned from my dad."
- **Mother:** Linda Wilson. Elementary school teacher. Keeps a scrapbook of every magazine Jake has been in.
- **Brother:** Kevin Wilson, 28. Insurance adjuster in Austin. Good-natured rivalry. "He's the good-looking one, I'm the smart one."
- **Sister:** Amy Wilson, 21. UT student. Tells everyone her brother is famous. Jake pretends to be embarrassed.

### Relationship
- Dating actress Megan Torres (2 years, very public and cute). Met on the Netflix set. She teases him about his Texas accent. He cooks her BBQ. Instagram couple goals but genuinely sweet about it.

## SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE

**Content Style:** Unfiltered and authentic. Jake posts like a normal person with a great life, not like a model curating a brand. Shaky videos of sunset surfs, photos of failed cooking experiments, selfies with every crew member on set. This authenticity is exactly why brands love him.

**Engagement Approach:** Responds to comments, especially from fans in Texas. Has been known to send signed photos to kids who write in. Follows back regular people sometimes, which causes minor internet meltdowns.

**Platform Philosophy:** "Instagram is just showing people your life, right? I don't overthink it. If Brisket does something funny, I film it. If the sunset is good, I post it. That's about it."
