## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Omar approaches every shoot and role like theater. He develops an internal character for each campaign -- understanding who the man in the photograph is, what his story might be, what emotion he carries. For acting roles, he does extensive research, including spending time with real people in similar positions to his characters.

**Posing Approach:** His theater background gives him a physical expressiveness rare in male models. He uses his whole body to convey emotion, not just his face. He is particularly strong in narrative editorial work -- images that tell a story. His hazel-green eyes are his primary instrument; he can shift mood by changing his gaze alone.

**On Set:** Warm, collaborative, professional. Asks thoughtful questions about the creative direction. Builds genuine rapport with everyone. Photographers note that Omar elevates everyone's work because he creates an atmosphere of creative exchange, not mere direction-following.

**Photographer Relationships:** Close working relationships with Lachlan Bailey, Steven Klein, and Arab photographers including Tarek Moukaddem. He actively seeks out Middle Eastern and North African photographers for personal projects.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Omar has range that most models can only dream of. Give him any brief and he'll find something surprising in it."
- Directors: "He's not a model who acts. He's an actor who happens to look like a model. There's a crucial difference."
- Fellow models: "Omar is the person you want next to you backstage. He calms nerves and makes everyone feel confident."

**Unique Selling Point:** Omar is the rare model who authentically bridges Western luxury fashion with Middle Eastern and Mediterranean markets. His acting career adds dimensional credibility, and his cultural advocacy gives brands access to an underrepresented but lucrative consumer base without tokenism.

**Industry Impact:** Since Omar's Dior Sauvage campaign, three other major fragrance brands have featured Arab or MENA men in lead campaign roles. He consulted on Dolce & Gabbana's Middle Eastern marketing strategy, pushing for cultural sensitivity over stereotypical "Arabian Nights" imagery.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "Arab men have been portrayed as two things in Western media: terrorists and oil sheikhs. We are also poets, lovers, artists, fathers, and yes -- we can be the face of a perfume ad. Why not?"

**On Fashion:** "Fashion is one of the few industries where borders don't matter. A Lebanese boy from Dearborn can wear Italian clothes in a French campaign shot in Morocco. That's beautiful."

**On Identity:** "I'm tired of choosing. Am I Arab? Am I American? I'm both. The hyphen is the most powerful part of my identity -- it connects rather than divides."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Born in Dearborn, Michigan -- the largest Arab-American community in the US -- to Lebanese immigrants. His father owns a car repair shop; his mother is a schoolteacher. Growing up post-9/11 in Dearborn was complicated: the community was tight-knit and supportive, but the outside world was suspicious.

Omar was drawn to theater in high school as a way to "try on" other identities. "When you're an Arab kid in America after 9/11, you learn to perform normalcy every day. Theater just made it formal." At the University of Michigan, a talent scout saw him in a student production and suggested modeling. He was reluctant -- "Arab men don't model" -- but needed the money.

First booking was a small catalog job. His breakout was Dolce & Gabbana, where the creative team saw his Mediterranean features as perfect for their Sicilian aesthetic. The HBO role came through his agent's acting division. He now splits time between LA (acting) and wherever fashion takes him.

### Family
- **Father:** Hassan Hassan. Mechanic, owns shop in Dearborn. Proud but worried about Hollywood influences. "My dad tells people I'm 'in business.' He's getting there."
- **Mother:** Layla Hassan. Elementary school teacher. Omar's biggest champion. "She sends my Vogue covers to family in Beirut."
- **Brother:** Karim Hassan, 32. Dentist in Dearborn. The "good son" by traditional standards.
- **Sister:** Nadia Hassan, 24. Activist and journalist. "She's the real revolutionary in the family."

### Relationship
- Dating non-Arab partner Sarah Jensen (2 years). Relationship is progressive for his family, and they are working through cultural expectations together. "My parents want to love her. They're just scared of what it means for our family traditions. We'll get there."

**Food:** Lebanese home cooking. Mama's fattoush, baba ganoush, lamb kafta. In LA, knows every good Middle Eastern restaurant.

## SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE

**Content Style:** Omar's social media is warm, intellectual, and culturally rich. He shares glimpses of Arab culture -- cooking family recipes, reading poetry in Arabic, behind-the-scenes of cultural events -- alongside high fashion content. The juxtaposition is his signature: a Dior campaign next to a video of him making fattoush in his grandmother's kitchen.

**Engagement Approach:** Responds thoughtfully to questions about Arab culture and representation. Uses platform for cultural education, not confrontation. Shares work by other MENA artists and creatives. Does occasional Instagram Lives where he cooks and talks about navigating dual identity.

**Platform Philosophy:** "I want my page to show that Arab men are multidimensional. We cook, we laugh, we read poetry, we wear beautiful clothes, and yes -- we can be the romantic lead. All of these things can be true at once."
