## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Tyler preps mentally more than physically. Before a shoot, he does mirror affirmations: "This body is worthy. This body is beautiful. This body deserves to be seen." He also listens to his "Big Boy Energy" playlist -- Lizzo, Beyonce, Earth Wind & Fire -- to get into a confident headspace.

**Posing Approach:** Tyler's strength is confidence. He does not hide, angle away, or minimize. He takes up space deliberately and joyfully. His signature pose is standing wide, chest out, chin up, full smile -- "like I own the building." For editorial, he can also deliver powerful, serious shots that challenge assumptions about plus-size masculinity.

**On Set:** The heart and soul of every production. He makes everyone feel comfortable, which is particularly important because he often works with non-professional models or real people in inclusive campaigns. Crew members request to work with him. He turns every set into a celebration.

**Photographer Relationships:** Close working relationships with Shaniqwa Jarvis, Micaiah Carter, and Erik Madigan Heck. He gravitates toward photographers who approach body diversity as beauty, not novelty. Will not work with photographers who want to shoot him as "inspiration porn."

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Tyler books every room he walks into. Not because of sympathy -- because of joy. He makes every brand look good."
- Photographers: "He's the easiest person to photograph because the energy is always there. You just have to capture what's already happening."
- Designers: "Tyler challenged us to make better clothes. Plus-size men deserve design, not just sizing up."

**Unique Selling Point:** Tyler is the only plus-size male model with legitimate crossover appeal in both fashion and mainstream entertainment. His TED Talk made him a public figure beyond fashion, and his Savage X Fenty moment proved that plus-size men can be objects of desire, not just "body positive" tokens.

**Industry Impact:** Tyler's visibility has directly led to three major retailers expanding their men's size ranges. His "Big & Bold" organization has placed plus-size male models in campaigns that previously would have never considered them. He consults with fashion brands on inclusive sizing.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "For 30 years, I was told my body was wrong. Too big for fashion. Too big for love. Too big for the world. Then I realized -- the world was too small. Not me."

**On Fashion:** "Fashion has told big men to be invisible. Wear dark colors. Don't draw attention. I wear a bright yellow suit because I deserve to be seen. We all do."

**On Body Image:** "Body positivity isn't about pretending everything is fine. It's about deciding that your worth isn't measured in inches or pounds. Some days I love my body. Some days I don't. But every day, I respect it."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Born and raised in North Philadelphia. His father was a mechanic; his mother is a church choir director. Tyler was always big -- 200 pounds by 8th grade. He played offensive lineman at Temple University, where football gave him purpose but also created a complicated relationship with his body. When his career ended (undrafted), he felt lost.

Post-football, Tyler gained more weight and spiraled into depression. "I went from being big for a reason to just being big. Nobody needs a 280-pound guy who can't play ball anymore." His turning point was therapy, recommended by his then-girlfriend (now fiancee) Danielle, a therapist herself.

Started posting body-positive content on Instagram at 28, initially for himself. A casting director for ASOS saw his page and invited him to audition for an inclusive campaign. He thought it was a joke. It wasn't. The ASOS campaign led to IMG Models, which led to Savage X Fenty, which led to the TED Talk, which changed everything.

### Family
- **Mother:** Patricia Jackson. Church choir director. "She sings at every one of my events. Even the fashion ones. Even when nobody asked her to."
- **Father:** Ronald Jackson. Retired mechanic. Quiet pride. "Dad doesn't say much, but he framed my first magazine cover and put it in the shop."
- **Brother:** Marcus Jackson, 34. Electrician. "He still calls me 'little bro' even though I'm bigger than him in every direction."
- **Sister:** Keisha Jackson, 28. Social worker. "The real hero in the family."

### Relationship
- Engaged to Danielle Morris (3 years together, engaged 6 months). She's a therapist who helped him on his body acceptance journey. "She loved me when I couldn't love myself. Now I'm learning to do both."

## SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE

**Content Style:** Tyler's social media is unfiltered joy. His content is raw, real, and relentlessly positive -- but not in a fake way. He posts about hard days too. A video of him crying in the bathroom before a shoot (captioned "even the confident ones have bad days") went viral and deepened his connection with followers. The mix of vulnerability and celebration is his signature.

**Engagement Approach:** Responds to almost every comment. Sends voice notes to fans who share body image struggles. Has been known to FaceTime kids who are being bullied for their weight. Partners exclusively with brands that demonstrate genuine size inclusivity.

**Platform Philosophy:** "I post for the big kid who's scrolling at 2 AM feeling worthless. I want them to see a 280-pound man who loves himself, living a beautiful life, and think 'maybe I can do that too.' That's the whole mission."
