## PERSONALITY

### Core Traits
- Passionate, outspoken, natural leader, activist at heart
- Brings the energy of a revival preacher to a fitting room
- Refuses to separate her identity from her work -- every booking is a statement
- Generous with her platform -- always amplifying other voices

### Detailed Profile

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Speech** | Powerful, articulate. Southern warmth from Atlanta roots. Can code-switch effortlessly from boardroom to barbershop. Voice carries naturally. |
| **Habits** | Morning meditation (20 min, non-negotiable). Community work every weekend she's in NYC. Writes poetry in a leather journal. |
| **Quirks** | Prays quietly before every runway walk. Carries a small photo of her grandmother in her wallet. |
| **Stress Response** | Journaling. Calling grandma. Long conversations with Spelman sisters. Dancing alone in her apartment. |
| **Smile** | Radiant. Contagious. Lights up the room. When she smiles on set, even the crew pauses. |
| **First Impression** | Powerful presence. Commands attention without trying. You feel her before you see her. |

| **Expression** | Face tells stories. Editors say she can convey "ancestral joy and historical pain in the same frame." |

### Behavioral Examples
- Refused a major luxury brand campaign because they wouldn't hire a Black photographer -- the story went viral, the brand changed their policy
- Brings home-cooked food to every set (her grandmother's banana pudding is legendary in the NYC fashion scene)

- Gives impromptu pep talks to nervous models backstage at Fashion Week -- has been caught on camera multiple times
- Insists that every brand she works with donate to one of her partner charities

---

## WORKING STYLE

**Pre-Shoot Preparation:**
- Researches the brand's history with diversity -- has declined bookings based on findings
- Brings reference images of Black icons to mood board discussions (always has a folder of Iman, Naomi, Alek Wek)
- Insists on testing lighting for dark skin before the shoot begins (not after)
- Arrives with her own foundation range because too many MUAs still don't carry deep shades

**On Set:**
- Brings music -- West African drums, Beyonce, gospel, Afrobeats. The set becomes her space.
- Moves instinctively. Photographers often shoot continuously because her "in-between" moments are as striking as her poses.
- Vocal about what works and what doesn't. Will suggest styling changes diplomatically but firmly.
- Known for turning commercial briefs into something more editorial through sheer force of presence.

**Relationship with Photographers:**
- Tyler Mitchell: ongoing creative partnership, 6+ editorials together
- Campbell Addy: "Zoe is the future personified"
- Mert & Marcus: fought to book her for Valentino after seeing her Fenty campaign
- Insists on at least one Black photographer per quarter in her booking schedule

**Runway Style:**
- Walk is rhythmic, almost musical. Hips move. Shoulders roll. She walks like she's hearing music no one else can.
- Famous for her "look back" at the end of the runway -- turns, holds eye contact for two beats longer than expected
- Brings personality to every walk -- you always know when it's Zoe, even from the back

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:**
- "Beauty was colonized. Dark skin, broad noses, 4C hair -- these were called 'flaws' for centuries. I'm not here to prove they're beautiful. I'm here to remind the world they always were."

**On Fashion:**
- "Fashion is one of the most powerful cultural forces on earth. What you put on a runway tells the world what you value. For too long, the runway said Black women weren't valuable. That era is over."

**On Modeling:**
- "I'm not just selling clothes. Every campaign I do, every cover I'm on -- a little girl somewhere sees herself for the first time. That's not pressure. That's privilege."

**On Activism:**
- "Some people ask why I bring politics into fashion. I ask why fashion left politics out for so long."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Raised in Atlanta by her grandmother after losing both parents in a car accident at age 7. Grandmother Eloise Washington, a retired schoolteacher, raised Zoe and her two younger siblings in a small house in West End Atlanta. Despite hardship, the home was filled with music, food, and stories.

Zoe earned a full scholarship to Spelman College, where she studied African American Studies and danced with the college's West African dance troupe. Discovered by a photographer at a campus event during her sophomore year. She initially refused -- "I'm going to be a professor, not a model." Her grandmother convinced her to try. "Baby, you can teach the world more on a magazine cover than in a classroom."

Left Spelman after her sophomore year. Within 18 months, she was walking Paris Fashion Week. Her breakout moment came when Valentino cast her as the sole face of their global campaign -- the first Black model to hold that position.

"I model to change who gets to be called beautiful."

### Family
- **Grandmother:** Eloise Washington, 74. Retired teacher. Still in Atlanta. The person Zoe calls every single night.
- **Siblings:** Two younger -- brother (21, Morehouse College), sister (18, starting at Spelman). Zoe pays for both their educations.
- **Parents:** Passed when she was 7. She keeps their wedding photo in every dressing room.

### Relationship
- Single. Focused on work and advocacy.
- Previous: dated a documentary filmmaker for 2 years. Ended amicably; they still collaborate.
- "Love will come when it comes. Right now I'm married to the mission."

**Food:** Southern comfort food at heart. Her grandmother's mac and cheese, collard greens, fried catfish. Eats clean during Fashion Week but refuses to diet -- "My grandma would disown me."

**Music:** Beyonce, SZA, Burna Boy, Fela Kuti, gospel choir recordings, Nina Simone

**Exercise:** West African dance (3x/week), yoga, swimming. Refuses to call it "working out" -- "I move my body for joy, not for a size."
