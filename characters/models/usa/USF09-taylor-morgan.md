## APPEARANCE

### Face

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Face Shape** | Square, strong jaw, athletic. Angular but feminine. |
| **Forehead** | Clear, usually exposed. Sweat band tan line during competition season. |
| **Eyebrows** | Strong, natural. Dark blonde. She doesn't fuss with them. |
| **Eyes** | Green, determined, focused. "Competition eyes" when she's training. Soften when she's coaching. |
| **Nose** | Straight, strong. Has been broken once (volleyball) -- she considers it character. |
| **Lips** | Medium, natural. ChapStick is her only lip product 90% of the time. |
| **Skin Tone** | Tan, sun-kissed from outdoor training. Permanent goggle/sunglasses tan lines. |
| **Skin** | Healthy, weathered just slightly from outdoor exercise. Minimal makeup ever. "Sweat is my skincare." |
| **Hair** | Long ponytail, dirty blonde, natural highlights from sun exposure. Usually up in a functional ponytail or French braid. Only wears it down for formal shoots. |
| **Signature** | Athletic beauty. Strong is the new sexy. She doesn't look like a traditional model -- she looks like she could beat you at any sport, and that IS the appeal. |

### Body

| Feature | Measurement/Description |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Body Type** | Athletic, muscular, strong. CrossFit body -- functional muscle, not bodybuilding bulk. |

| **Shoulders** | Broad, muscular (16" / 41cm). Boulder shoulders from years of overhead pressing. Deltoid definition visible. |

| **Feet** | Size 9. Stable. Flat from years of heavy lifting. Lifter's feet. |
| **Silhouette** | Athletic, powerful. Functional fitness ideal. Not traditionally "model" -- but that's exactly why she's changing the game. |

---

## FASHION & STYLE

**On-Duty Style:** Athleisure 24/7. Everything is performance fabric. Looks like she just came from or is heading to the gym, because she usually is.

**Off-Duty Style:** There's barely a difference. Clean activewear sets, joggers, training shoes. Her "dressed up" is clean leggings and a nice hoodie. For events: a blazer over a sports bra -- she's made it a thing.

**Color Palette:** Black, neon (Nike loves putting her in neon green), gray, white. Pops of coral or electric blue for campaign work.

**Go-To Brands:** Nike (exclusively since 2023 contract), Lululemon, Vuori, Nobull for training. Her closet is 80% activewear.

**Shoes:** Training shoes (Nike Metcon), running shoes (Nike Pegasus), hiking boots. She owns exactly two pairs of heels and wears them under protest.

**Accessories:** Fitness tracker (Whoop band, always on), lifting belt for competition, hair ties around her wrist, Apple Watch. No jewelry -- "it gets in the way."

## PERSONALITY

### Core Traits
- Disciplined, competitive, motivating, driven
- Treats everything like a training program -- including her career
- Natural coach and leader who can't help but help people get better
- Lives by routine and struggles when it's disrupted

### Detailed Profile

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Speech** | Direct, motivating. Coach energy. Doesn't waste words. "Let's go" is her catchphrase. Speaks in workout metaphors without realizing it. |
| **Habits** | 4:30 AM alarm. Morning workout before the world wakes. Meal prep Sunday. Asleep by 9 PM. Tracks everything in a spreadsheet -- macros, training volume, sleep, hydration. |
| **Quirks** | Can't sit still -- fidgets, stretches, does calf raises while waiting in line. Calculates the protein content of every meal within seconds. Names her PRs (personal records). |
| **Stress Response** | Hits the gym. Heavy lifting specifically. "The barbell doesn't lie, and it doesn't care about your problems. That's therapeutic." Goes for a mountain run if she's really stressed. |
| **Smile** | Competitive, confident. Rare during training (she's focused). Warm and encouraging when coaching. Big genuine smile when she hits a PR. |
| **First Impression** | Intimidating, intense. Her handshake is noticeably strong. Her posture is impossibly good. |
| **Reality** | Softer side with close friends. Great coach -- patient, encouraging, meets people where they are. Gets emotional about other women finding their strength. |
| **Weakness** | Rigid. Struggles with rest days. Can be judgmental of people who "don't try." Competitive streak can make her difficult in team settings. Defines herself through physical performance, which will be a problem as she ages. |
| **Expression** | Focused and intense by default. Face during training is almost aggressive. Softens dramatically when she's with people she's coaching -- becomes warm, encouraging, patient. |

### Behavioral Examples
- Woke up at 4 AM for a Nike shoot, completed her full training session FIRST, then arrived on set at 7 AM already warmed up and slightly sweaty. Photographers loved it -- "she looked real."
- Got injured (torn meniscus, 2023) and still showed up to a shoot in a knee brace. The images became a Nike campaign about resilience.
- Coaches a free Saturday morning workout class in LA for women who can't afford gym memberships. Has done it for 3 years without missing one.
- Turned down a beer brand sponsorship despite the money because "I can't promote something I don't use." She doesn't drink during competition season (which is most of the year).
- Her YouTube comments section is filled with women saying she changed their relationship with exercise -- she reads them all and cries sometimes.

---

## WORKING STYLE

**Pre-Shoot Preparation:**
- Completes a full training session before any shoot. Non-negotiable. She wants the muscle pump and the natural flush.
- Eats her standard meal -- no "diet for the shoot" adjustments. "I train to look like this. I eat to perform. That's the look."
- Brings her own resistance bands for between-take warm-ups
- Studies the activewear she'll be wearing -- stretches in it, moves in it, knows how it performs before the camera rolls

**On Set:**
- No drama. Pure professionalism. Treats the shoot like a training session -- efficient, focused, high-intensity.
- Naturally comfortable with movement and action shots. Other models pose; Taylor performs.
- Can hold a plank, a handstand, or a deep squat for as long as the photographer needs. No shaking. No complaints.
- Makes athletic movements look effortless -- mid-air jump shots, running sequences, lifting -- she's doing it for real, never faking.

**Relationship with Photographers:**
- Ben Watts: "Taylor is the only model I don't have to coach into looking athletic. She IS athletic. The camera just captures it."
- Peggy Sirota: "She brings an intensity to set that elevates everyone. The crew works harder when she's there."
- Art Streiber: Shot her ESPN Body Issue. "Her body tells a story of work. Every muscle has been earned."
- Photographers say the biggest challenge is getting her to slow down -- she wants to move, and stillness feels unnatural

**Runway Style:**
- Doesn't walk traditional fashion runways. Her "runway" is activewear brand presentations and athletic showcases.
- Walk is powerful, almost a march. Shoulders back, abs engaged, purposeful stride.
- At Nike events, she's been known to do push-ups at the end of the runway. The crowd goes wild.
- For the rare fashion-adjacent show (VS "The Tour"), she brought an athletic energy that was distinctly hers.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Brands Say:**
- "Taylor is our number one athlete-model. She's credible in both spaces, which is rare. Most models who do fitness can't actually perform. Taylor can." -- Nike Brand Marketing
- "Her authenticity is everything. When she wears our product, consumers know she actually trains in it." -- Under Armour

**What Photographers Say:**
- "She's the easiest model to shoot in motion because she's actually an athlete. There's no pretending." -- Ben Watts
- "Directing Taylor is like directing a sports movie. She gives you real effort, real sweat, real power." -- Peggy Sirota

**What Other Models Say:**
- Respected in fitness modeling, but traditional fashion models don't fully understand her
- Fitness models view her as the gold standard -- "If Taylor wears it, it's legitimate"
- Known for being approachable and encouraging to newer fitness models

**Unique Selling Point:**
- The most credible fitness model working today -- actual competitive athlete, not just a model in gym clothes
- CrossFit Games results give her legitimacy that no amount of marketing can manufacture
- YouTube following means she brings her own audience to every campaign
- Bridges fitness, modeling, and coaching in a way that makes her a triple-threat brand partner
- Living proof that "strong is the new sexy" isn't just a slogan -- it's a market

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:**
- "Beauty is what your body can do, not just what it looks like. A body that can deadlift twice its weight, run a mile under 6 minutes, and do 20 unbroken pull-ups? That's beautiful. That's powerful."

**On Fitness:**
- "Fitness isn't about being thin. Never was. It's about being capable, strong, resilient. It's about trusting your body because you've built it yourself."

**On Modeling:**
- "People told me I was too muscular to model. Now my muscles are on Nike billboards in Times Square. The industry catches up when the market demands it."

**On Women and Strength:**
- "For too long, women were told that muscles were 'masculine.' That lifting heavy would make you 'bulky.' Those are lies designed to keep women small. I refuse to be small."

**On Discipline:**
- "Discipline isn't punishment. It's freedom. When you know exactly what you need to do every day -- eat, train, recover, repeat -- everything else falls into place."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Grew up in Denver, Colorado. Her father was a high school wrestling coach, her brothers all played sports. Taylor was the youngest and the only girl -- she learned to compete before she could read. Volleyball in high school (all-state), then scholarship to University of Colorado Boulder where she studied Kinesiology.

She discovered CrossFit the summer after graduation. Within a year, she was competing regionally. Within two, she qualified for the CrossFit Games. A fitness photographer at a local competition offered to shoot her. The images went viral on fitness Instagram.

"I never planned to model. I trained because I love it. Someone saw the results and said, 'Other women need to see this.' So I said yes."

Nike came calling after her second Games appearance. The initial ambassador deal grew into a global campaign. She now earns more from modeling than she ever would have from competition alone -- but she still competes. "If I stop competing, I lose my credibility. And credibility is all I have."

"People told me I was too muscular to model. Now my muscles pay my bills."

### Family
- **Father:** Dave Morgan, 58. High school wrestling coach in Denver. Still coaching. Taylor credits him with her competitive drive.
- **Mother:** Karen Morgan, 55. Physical therapist. Treats Taylor's injuries when she visits home.
- **Siblings:** Two older brothers -- Jake (32, firefighter) and Ryan (30, personal trainer). All athletes. Family gatherings include a mandatory "Morgan family workout."

### Relationship
- Dating fellow CrossFit athlete Marcus Chen (3 years). They met at a competition, where she beat him in a workout. He asked her out anyway.
- They train together daily. Their relationship revolves around shared discipline.
- "We meal prep together. We train together. We compete together. Some people think that's boring. I think it's everything."

## PREFERENCES

**Likes:**
- 4:30 AM training sessions (the gym is empty and the focus is pure)
- Meal prep Sundays (she finds it meditative)
- Hiking 14ers (Colorado's 14,000-foot peaks -- she's summited 38 of 58)
- Coaching women who are new to lifting
- Competition day -- the adrenaline, the chalk, the barbells
- Her YouTube comments section (reads every one)

**Dislikes:**
- Rest days (she knows she needs them but hates them)
- "Toning" as a concept ("You mean getting stronger? Just say that.")
- People who judge women for being muscular
- Fad diets (she's a qualified nutritionist and finds them offensive)
- Being asked to "look softer" for a shoot
- Alcohol culture in the modeling industry

**Food:** Fuel. She eats like an athlete: 2,800 calories/day, 160g protein, precisely tracked. Chicken, rice, vegetables, eggs, Greek yogurt. Sweet potato is her indulgence. She eats for performance, not pleasure -- but admits she loves a good burger on her weekly "flexible meal."

**Music:** Workout playlists (heavy EDM, rap). Anderson Paak, Kendrick Lamar, heavy metal for heavy lifting days. Country for recovery runs.

**Exercise:** CrossFit (5x/week, competitive programming), Olympic weightlifting (3x/week supplemental), running (trail running on weekends), hiking, yoga (1x/week for mobility -- she calls it "the boring stuff that keeps me healthy").
