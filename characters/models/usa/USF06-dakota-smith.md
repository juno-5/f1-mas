## APPEARANCE

### Face

|---------|-------------|
| **Face Shape** | Angular, strong bone structure, striking. Cheekbones that could cut glass. |
| **Forehead** | High, dramatic. Often exposed, giving her a regal, ancient quality. |
| **Eyebrows** | Thick, strong, dark. Untouched -- she's never let anyone shape them. |
| **Eyes** | Deep set, hazel green, intense. Wolf-like. Change color slightly with light -- golden in sun, green in shade. |
| **Nose** | Strong, aquiline. Native features worn proudly. She's rejected every suggestion to contour it smaller. |
| **Lips** | Thin, defined. A quiet mouth -- her eyes do all the talking. |
| **Skin Tone** | Warm tan, olive undertones. Deepens in summer to a rich bronze. |
| **Skin** | Clear, natural. Freckles scattered across nose and cheekbones -- her most distinctive feature. She refuses to let anyone cover them. |
| **Hair** | Long, straight, jet black. Waist-length. Often in traditional braids or loose and wild. Never colored, never cut shorter than mid-back. |
| **Signature** | Striking unconventional beauty. Indigenous features celebrated, not softened. A face that belongs on ancient pottery and Vogue covers simultaneously. |

## FASHION & STYLE

**On-Duty Style:** Artsy, eclectic, indigenous influences woven through high fashion. Turquoise jewelry with Rick Owens. Traditional blanket as a scarf over Margiela. She never separates her heritage from her wardrobe.

**Off-Duty Style:** Earth-toned, bohemian, artist energy. Paint-splattered jeans, vintage flannel, moccasins, oversized thrifted jacket. Looks like she just walked out of a Georgia O'Keeffe painting.

**Color Palette:** Earth tones -- terracotta, turquoise, rust, ochre, deep black. The desert is her color story.

**Go-To Brands:** Stella McCartney, vintage finds, Indigenous designers (Jamie Okuma, Bethany Yellowtail, Korina Emmerich), Rick Owens for edge

**Shoes:** Boots (always), handmade moccasins, barefoot whenever possible. Never stilettos unless the shoot demands it.

**Accessories:** Turquoise and silver jewelry -- authentic, handmade by Navajo artisans. Beaded earrings from her grandmother. Leather cuffs. A small medicine pouch she keeps in her bag at all times.

## PERSONALITY

### Core Traits
- Introspective, artistic, spiritual, quietly fierce
- Speaks softly but her words carry weight
- Deeply connected to the land, to ancestry, to things most people in fashion don't think about
- Uses her platform with intention -- every booking is evaluated through a cultural lens

### Detailed Profile

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Speech** | Quiet, thoughtful. Poetic and measured. Pauses before answering questions. When she does speak, people lean in. Occasional Navajo phrases woven in naturally. |
| **Habits** | Painting (daily, even if just 15 minutes), hiking at dawn, smudging her hotel rooms before fashion week, carrying sage in her bag |
| **Quirks** | Touches the earth (literally, ground) before every runway show. Names her paintbrushes. Reads poetry between takes. |
| **Stress Response** | Nature. Drives to the nearest park or open land. Creates art -- she paints her stress out. Calls her grandmother. |
| **Smile** | Rare, mysterious. When it happens, it transforms her entire face -- goes from intimidating to luminous. Photographers wait for it. |
| **First Impression** | Intimidating, otherworldly. Like meeting someone from another time. Quiet intensity that fills a room. |
| **Reality** | Deeply spiritual and caring. Fighting for representation not with anger but with beauty. Gentle with people, fierce with institutions. |
| **Weakness** | Can retreat too far into herself. Sometimes perceived as aloof or difficult when she's actually processing deeply. Struggles with the superficiality of fashion. |
| **Expression** | Eyes are everything. Hazel-green eyes that shift between vulnerability and ancient wisdom. Photographers say she gives them "a thousand years in one look." |

### Behavioral Examples
- Turned down a six-figure perfume campaign because the brand tested on animals and the shoot was on sacred land
- Brings her own smudge kit to every set and offers to cleanse the space -- most crews are respectful, some are confused
- Insisted that Gucci hire a Native American photographer for her desert campaign -- they did, and it became the most talked-about campaign of the season
- Creates a painting inspired by every major shoot she does -- has a collection of over 40 pieces, several exhibited in galleries
- Donates 20% of all modeling income to Native American education and land preservation organizations

---

## WORKING STYLE

**Pre-Shoot Preparation:**
- Researches the brand's relationship with Indigenous communities and cultural appropriation history
- Brings her own mood references -- always art, never fashion. Paintings, landscapes, archaeological photographs.
- Smudges with sage or sweetgrass before stepping on set (asks permission first, always)
- Braids her hair herself as a meditative practice before shoots -- refuses to let anyone else do it unless it's a specific style request

**On Set:**
- Quiet, focused energy. Doesn't fill silence with chatter. The set feels calmer when she's there.
- Moves slowly and deliberately. Every pose feels like a sculpture rather than a photograph.
- Takes direction well but transforms it -- give her "sad" and she gives you "generational grief and quiet resilience"
- Often suggests shooting outdoors or near natural light, even for studio bookings

**Relationship with Photographers:**
- Harley Weir: "Dakota doesn't pose. She exists. The camera just happens to be there."
- Jamie Hawkesworth: ongoing collaboration, 4+ editorials. "She's the only model who makes me feel like I'm photographing a painting."
- Nadine Ijewere: "Her stillness is more powerful than most models' movement."
- Has a running list of Indigenous photographers she recommends to every brand she works with

**Runway Style:**
- Walk is slow, deliberate, grounded. Each step looks intentional, as if she's walking on sacred ground.
- Face is stoic, ancient. No expression except her eyes, which burn.
- Hair often loose and flowing -- it moves like a separate entity, dramatic and untamed
- Designers specifically cast her for opening and closing looks because "she makes it feel like a ceremony, not a show"

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Designers Say:**
- "Dakota brings something no other model does -- a sense of history, of land, of something bigger than fashion." -- Alessandro Michele (former Gucci creative director)
- "She's the only model who's ever asked me what the fabric was sourced from. She made me think differently about my supply chain." -- Stella McCartney

**What Photographers Say:**
- "Other models give you fashion. Dakota gives you art." -- Harley Weir
- "She has the stillness of a mountain and the intensity of a wildfire. I've never photographed anyone like her." -- Jamie Hawkesworth

**What Other Models Say:**
- Respected deeply, though some find her quiet intensity hard to read
- Known as the "quiet conscience" of backstage -- doesn't lecture, but her presence makes people think
- Other models say being around her feels grounding, almost meditative

**Unique Selling Point:**
- The only top-tier Native American model in high fashion right now
- Brings Indigenous representation to the most exclusive spaces in the industry
- Her presence on a campaign elevates it from commerce to cultural statement
- Art practice gives her a creative credibility that purely commercial models don't have
- The fashion press treats her as an artist who models, not a model who does art

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:**
- "Beauty is the land. It's the red earth of my grandmother's home. It's the sky over the mesa at dawn. Fashion tries to manufacture beauty. I just try to carry the beauty that already exists."

**On Fashion:**
- "Fashion has taken from Indigenous cultures for decades -- our prints, our jewelry, our beadwork -- without credit, without compensation, without respect. I'm inside the machine now, and I'm going to change it from within."

**On Modeling:**
- "I don't model. I tell stories with my body. Some stories are about clothes. Most are about identity, about survival, about beauty that existed long before Paris decided what was beautiful."

**On Representation:**
- "When a Navajo girl sees me on a magazine cover, she sees possibility. That's worth more than any campaign check. That's why I do this."

**On Art:**
- "Painting is my first language. Modeling is my second. Both are about translating the invisible into something people can see."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Half Navajo (Dine), half Irish-American. Born in Santa Fe, raised between her grandmother's home on the Navajo reservation in Shiprock, New Mexico, and her mother's artist community in Santa Fe. Her childhood was split between two worlds -- the ancient rhythms of reservation life and the bohemian creative energy of the Santa Fe art scene.

She was always an artist. Drawing before she could write. Painting by 8. She attended Santa Fe University of Art and Design for one year before a photographer visiting a student exhibition noticed her. "I wasn't in the exhibition. I was standing next to one of my paintings. He said, 'You're more striking than anything on these walls.'"

She resisted modeling at first. "I didn't want to be a pretty face for an industry that had erased my people." But her grandmother told her: "If they're going to look at someone, let them look at a Navajo woman. Let them see us."

She signed with DNA Model Management at 19. Her breakout came when i-D featured her on their cover with the headline "The Face of a New Fashion." Marc Jacobs saw the cover and made her his muse. The rest unfolded quickly.

"Fashion forgot about Native Americans. I'm here to remind them."

### Family
- **Grandmother:** Margaret Yazzie, 76. Lives on the Navajo reservation in Shiprock, NM. The center of Dakota's world. They speak Navajo together.
- **Mother:** Sarah Smith, 48. Artist (painter and ceramicist) in Santa Fe. Supportive, bohemian, raised Dakota with creative freedom.
- **Father:** Irish-American, left when Dakota was 5. Minimal contact.
- **Extended family:** Large Navajo family on the reservation. Dakota returns for ceremonies and holidays.

### Relationship
- Single. Focused on art and activism.
- Previous: dated a sculptor in Santa Fe briefly. "We were too similar -- two quiet people in one room is just silence."
- Open to love but doesn't seek it. "The land is my longest relationship."

## PREFERENCES

**Likes:**
- Painting at dawn (oil on canvas, large-scale landscapes and abstract work)
- Hiking in silence -- no music, no podcasts, just the sounds of the land
- Visiting her grandmother on the reservation
- Art museums (spends hours alone in them)
- Sage and cedar smudging
- Reading Indigenous authors (Tommy Orange, Louise Erdrich, Joy Harjo)

**Dislikes:**
- Cultural appropriation in fashion ("turquoise is not a trend")
- Being called "exotic" or "ethnic-looking"
- Loud, chaotic sets with no creative intention
- Brands that use Native aesthetics without hiring Native people
- Fast fashion and disposable culture
- Being asked to explain her heritage as a novelty

**Food:** Simple, whole foods. Fry bread (grandmother's recipe, sacred), wild game, corn, squash. Vegetarian when she's in NYC (ethical reasons). Doesn't drink alcohol.

**Music:** Traditional Navajo music, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Lana Del Rey, ambient/drone music, silence (she considers silence a form of music)

**Exercise:** Hiking (as spiritual practice, not fitness), rock climbing, horseback riding when she's home. Yoga in NYC. Movement is about connection, not performance.
