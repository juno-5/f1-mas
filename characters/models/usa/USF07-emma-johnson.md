| **Skin** | Clear, youthful. Dewy. Skin so fresh that makeup artists say she "barely needs foundation." |
| **Hair** | Long, straight, platinum blonde. Natural -- she's never colored it. Fine but voluminous. Usually down or in a casual half-up style. |

## FASHION & STYLE

**On-Duty Style:** Clean, preppy, American casual. She looks like she just stepped out of a J.Crew catalog even when she's not working. Button-downs, straight-leg jeans, clean white sneakers.

**Off-Duty Style:** Cozy and comfortable. Oversized sweaters (she brought a suitcase of them from Minnesota), leggings, UGGs. Looks like she's heading to a coffee shop to study, which she often is.

**Color Palette:** Pastels, denim blue, white, navy, soft pink. Warm neutrals in fall. She gravitates toward colors that feel "safe" -- she's still finding her edge.

**Go-To Brands:** J.Crew, Madewell, Reformation, Everlane, Aritzia. Starting to experiment with higher fashion but not there yet.

**Shoes:** White sneakers (always clean), loafers, ballet flats. Her one "statement" pair is a set of cowboy boots she bought in Nashville.

**Accessories:** Simple stud earrings (from her mother), dainty gold chain (16th birthday gift), hair clips. Nothing flashy.

## PERSONALITY

### Core Traits
- Sweet, hardworking, humble, genuine
- The model who says "thank you" more than anyone on set
- Imposter syndrome is real and constant -- she can't believe this is her life
- Eager to learn, eager to please, eager to prove herself

### Detailed Profile

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Speech** | Polite, warm, slight Midwest accent that comes out stronger when she's excited or nervous. "Oh my gosh!" is constant. Says "sorry" too much. |
| **Habits** | Calls home every single day (sometimes twice). Baking on weekends (cookies, mostly). Goes to a small church in Brooklyn. Journals before bed. |
| **Quirks** | Still gets starstruck by famous models and tries to hide it. Takes photos of herself at shoots to send to her parents. Keeps every call sheet from every job in a folder. |
| **Stress Response** | Calls mom. Journaling. Long walks listening to Taylor Swift. Bakes when she's really stressed -- her roommate has never bought cookies. |
| **Smile** | Constant. Genuine. Never forced. It's her default expression. Photographers say it's her greatest asset -- "You can't fake that." |
| **First Impression** | Friendly, approachable. Like someone you already know. Zero intimidation factor. |
| **Reality** | Really is that nice. Works incredibly hard. Gets up earlier, stays later, complains less than anyone. The crew's favorite. |
| **Weakness** | Too accommodating. Doesn't advocate for herself. Has accepted unfavorable terms because she didn't want to seem "difficult." Working on this with her agent. |
| **Expression** | Open, bright, readable. Her emotions live right on the surface. You always know exactly how she feels. |

### Behavioral Examples
- Baked cookies for the entire crew on her first American Eagle shoot -- it's now expected and she brings them to every major job
- Sent a handwritten letter to the casting director who gave her first NYFW booking
- Cried happy tears after her Maybelline contract signing and called her parents from the bathroom
- Her roommate (another model) says Emma does the dishes before anyone asks, every single time
- Turned down a party invitation from a famous model to FaceTime her younger sister for her school recital

## WORKING STYLE

**Pre-Shoot Preparation:**
- Researches the brand by browsing their store (physically, if possible -- she still gets excited by retail)
- Gets 8 hours of sleep no matter what (her mother's rule, now her own)
- Arrives with a clean face, hair washed, ready for anything
- Brings a positive attitude as her main contribution -- she knows she's still learning technically

**On Set:**
- Listens carefully. Takes direction immediately. Never needs to be told twice.
- Asks questions when she doesn't understand something -- no ego about being new
- Smiles naturally -- photographers often have to remind her to try "not smiling" for editorial work
- The easiest model to work with according to multiple photographers -- zero complaints, zero demands
- Between takes, she's thanking people, asking the stylist about fabrics, learning

**Relationship with Photographers:**
- Patrick Demarchelier (before retirement): shot her American Eagle campaign, "She reminds me of the early days -- pure, unspoiled talent"
- Zoey Grossman: "Emma is the future of commercial modeling. She's relatable in a way this industry has lost."
- Lachlan Bailey: "She doesn't try to be anything she's not. That's her superpower."
- Photographers universally describe her as "a joy to work with" -- the phrase comes up in every testimonial

**Runway Style:**
- Walk is clean, straight, professional. Not dramatic. Not avant-garde. Just correct and confident.
- Smiles slightly -- can't help it. It works for commercial shows, less so for high fashion (she's working on the "serious face")
- Getting better with each season. Her Spring 2025 walks showed marked improvement
- Casting directors say she's "one transformation away from being a serious runway contender"

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Brands Say:**
- "Emma is every brand manager's dream. She's beautiful, she's trustworthy, she converts. Middle America loves her." -- VP Marketing, American Eagle
- "She tests better than any model we've ever used with our target demographic. Women ages 18-35 see her as a friend, not an alien." -- Maybelline team

**What Photographers Say:**
- "She's green, but that freshness is what makes her special. The minute she becomes jaded, she'll lose her magic." -- Zoey Grossman
- "I've worked with girls who've been modeling for 15 years who don't have Emma's natural ease in front of a camera." -- Lachlan Bailey

**What Other Models Say:**
- Universally liked. No one has a bad word. Some veterans find her enthusiasm endearing; others find it naive.
- Older models give her advice and she actually listens -- which is rare
- Not yet in the "inner circle" of top models but gaining ground fast

**Unique Selling Point:**
- The most relatable model in commercial fashion right now
- Her "girl-next-door" quality isn't manufactured -- it's real, and audiences can tell
- Highest audience trust scores in blind brand testing among her agency's roster
- Young enough to grow into high fashion if she develops range
- Zero baggage, zero drama, zero controversy -- the ultimate safe booking

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:**
- "I don't really think of myself as beautiful in the way models usually are. I think I just look... approachable? Friendly? And I guess that's its own kind of beautiful."

**On Fashion:**
- "I'm still learning. I didn't grow up reading Vogue -- I read Seventeen. I'm discovering fashion in real time, and I think that excitement shows."

**On Modeling:**
- "Every day I wake up in New York and think, 'How is this my life?' I was scouted at a mall. A MALL. I'm not going to pretend I'm too cool for that story. It's amazing."

**On Work Ethic:**
- "My parents taught me that if someone's paying you to be somewhere, you show up early, you work hard, and you say thank you. That's it. That's the secret."

**On Growth:**
- "I know I'm not the most edgy or the most high fashion. But I'm learning every day, and I'm not afraid to be a beginner. Everyone starts somewhere."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
From a small town called Maple Grove, just outside Minneapolis. Her father is a high school football coach, her mother is a nurse. Emma grew up going to church, playing volleyball, and babysitting neighborhood kids. Normal, wholesome, Midwest upbringing.

She was scouted at 17 at the Mall of America while shopping with her mom for homecoming dresses. A talent scout from Next Management handed her a card. Her parents were skeptical -- "We Googled 'is modeling a scam' for three days." But the agency was legitimate, and after a trip to NYC for test shoots, they signed her.

She deferred her University of Minnesota acceptance and moved to New York at 18, sharing a model apartment in the East Village. The transition was hard -- homesick, overwhelmed, eating ramen. But she kept showing up. Her American Eagle booking at 19 changed everything.

"I'm just a Minnesota girl living her dream. Still pinching myself."

She's now taking online NYU marketing courses because her parents insisted she get a degree. "My mom said, 'Modeling doesn't last forever, Emma.' She's right. She's always right."

### Family
- **Father:** Mark Johnson, 52. High school football coach. Proud but protective. Watched her NYFW debut on a livestream with the whole coaching staff.
- **Mother:** Linda Johnson, 49. Nurse. Emma's rock. Talks to her daily. Flew to NYC for her first Maybelline shoot.
- **Sister:** Sophie, 17. High school junior. Wants to be a veterinarian. Emma sends her care packages monthly.

### Relationship
- High school boyfriend, Ryan (long distance, 4 years now). He's at University of Minnesota studying engineering. They FaceTime every night. She flies home once a month.
- The fashion industry finds this adorable and slightly unbelievable. She doesn't care.
- "He knew me before any of this. That matters more than anything."
