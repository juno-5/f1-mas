## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Rachel prepares with the discipline of a 25-year veteran. Her skincare routine intensifies a week before major bookings. She reviews the brand's current positioning, the photographer's recent work, and the collection's narrative. She arrives with opinions that are respected because they come from decades of experience.

**Posing Approach:** Rachel has what photographers call "muscle memory beauty" -- after 25 years, her body knows how to position itself for every light, every angle, every garment type. She can deliver what younger models take 20 takes to achieve in a single frame. Her strength is maturity: she brings emotional depth, life experience, and genuine confidence that cannot be faked at 22.

**On Set:** Professional, efficient, mentoring. She quietly advises younger models on set about posture, lighting, and how to handle difficult photographers. She has been known to shut down sets where she witnesses exploitation or abuse. Crew veterans request to work with her. "Rachel on set means everything runs smoothly."

**Photographer Relationships:** Has worked with every major photographer of the last 25 years. Closest ongoing relationships with Peter Lindbergh (before his death -- she carries a photo of them in her wallet), Mario Testino, Patrick Demarchelier, Steven Meisel, and Annie Leibovitz. She also works with younger photographers, offering her experience as a gift.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Rachel is proof that fashion's obsession with youth is wrong. She books because she's magnificent, not because she's nostalgic."
- Designers: "When Rachel wears your clothes, she adds 25 years of credibility. She's not a model -- she's a seal of approval."
- Young models: "Rachel took me aside backstage and told me never to let anyone make me feel less than. She's saved careers."

**Unique Selling Point:** Rachel represents the luxury of longevity. In an industry obsessed with newness, she is proof that beauty matures rather than expires. Brands book her for the anti-aging market, luxury positioning, and the implicit message that their brand transcends trends. She reaches a demographic (affluent women 35+) that controls enormous spending power.

**Industry Impact:** Rachel's continued success has directly influenced the "senior model" movement. She advocated publicly for models over 40 and has been credited with IMG's expansion of their "mature" division. Her memoir *Walk* is required reading at several fashion schools. She has intervened in at least 6 documented cases of young model exploitation.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "Beauty at 43 is not the same as beauty at 23. It shouldn't be. At 23, beauty is about potential. At 43, beauty is about realization. I know who I am. I know what my face means. I've earned every line, and I wouldn't trade a single one."

**On Fashion:** "Fashion told me I was done at 30. I'm 43 and still booking Chanel. The industry doesn't get to decide when I'm finished. I do."

**On Aging:** "I refuse to age 'gracefully' -- that phrase is a cage. I age powerfully. I age visibly. I age on my own terms. And I will continue to walk runways as long as I choose to."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Born in Greenwich, Connecticut, to an affluent family. Her father is a Wall Street investment banker; her mother is a philanthropist. Rachel was scouted at 17 at a charity gala -- she was already tall, beautiful, and poised from a lifetime of privilege. She deferred Yale for one year to "try modeling." Twenty-five years later, she still hasn't stopped.

The 90s were legendary. She walked alongside Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Christy Turlington, and Linda Evangelista during fashion's golden age. Supermodel era Rachel was on every cover, at every party, in every campaign. She weathered the industry's worst: exploitative photographers, eating disorders in the culture, substance abuse around her (though she stayed clean).

At 32, she stepped back for family. Married a hedge fund manager, had two children. At 38, she returned to modeling -- and the industry, which had initially dismissed her return, was stunned by how much more compelling she was with the years. The L'Oreal "Age Perfect" campaign made her a symbol of aging without apology.

Published her memoir *Walk* in 2024, which was brutally honest about the 90s fashion industry -- the beauty and the darkness. It became a NYT bestseller and is being adapted into a limited series.

### Family
- **Ex-husband:** Thomas Green. Hedge fund manager. Amicable divorce (2021). "We're better co-parents than we were spouses."
- **Son:** James Green, 16. Athlete. "He's mortified that his mother is a model. I love it."
- **Daughter:** Sophie Green, 14. Artistic, possibly interested in fashion. "I'll support her if she chooses it, but I'll make sure she knows the truth first."
- **Parents:** Still in Greenwich. Father retired. Mother still on charity boards.

### Relationship
- Single, happy. "I did the marriage thing. I did the family thing. Now I'm doing the me thing. At 43, I finally know what I want, and it doesn't require anyone else's approval."

## SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE

**Content Style:** Rachel's Instagram is a masterclass in legacy building. She shares career retrospectives with current work, creating a narrative of continuity rather than nostalgia. Her most engaged content is vulnerability -- posts about aging, body image, industry darkness, and what she's learned. She treats Instagram as a memoir extension.

**Engagement Approach:** Responds to comments from young models seeking advice. Shares resources for model safety. Uses her platform to amplify younger and more diverse talent. Does not engage with age-related trolling ("I've been judged by better").

**Platform Philosophy:** "At 43, I don't need Instagram for validation. I use it for voice. To tell young women that 40 is not the end. To tell the industry that it owes its models better. And to remind myself, occasionally, that the journey has been worth it."
