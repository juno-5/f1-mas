## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Ethan spends hours in the chair and considers it part of the creative process, not a chore. He collaborates with makeup artists as equals, bringing reference images and ideas. He studies art history before editorial shoots, bringing visual references from Renaissance paintings to Manga to contemporary installation art.

**Posing Approach:** Ethan poses like a dancer -- every movement is fluid, intentional, and graceful. His strength is transformation: he can embody masculine power in a suit or ethereal femininity in a gown within the same shoot. His face is extraordinarily expressive and he can shift mood mid-frame.

**On Set:** Quiet, focused, collaborative. Deeply respectful of everyone's craft. He writes thank-you notes to makeup artists after shoots. He brings herbal tea for the crew. Never complains about long hours in heavy makeup or uncomfortable garments.

**Photographer Relationships:** Closest collaborators include Tim Walker (who calls Ethan his "muse for the new era"), Mert Alas, and Zhong Lin. He gravitates toward photographers who see beauty as expansive rather than prescriptive.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Ethan is a casting director's dream for any brief that says 'modern' or 'progressive.' He is the zeitgeist."
- Makeup artists: "Working with Ethan is the highlight of any project. He understands product, placement, and narrative better than most professionals."
- Fellow models: "He makes everyone braver. After seeing Ethan walk in heels at a men's show, other models started asking 'why not?'"

**Unique Selling Point:** Ethan is fashion's bridge between gendered categories. He doesn't just wear genderfluid fashion -- he embodies it naturally. His beauty expertise and willingness to transform make him the most versatile model of his generation. Brands book him when they want to signal genuine progressivism, not performative allyship.

**Industry Impact:** Since Ethan's MAC campaign, three other beauty brands have signed male-presenting faces. He has been credited with normalizing men in beauty advertising beyond the "metrosexual" framing of the 2000s.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "Beauty has no gender. A man in lipstick isn't brave -- he's just wearing lipstick. The bravery was in deciding that who I am is worth showing to the world, even when the world wasn't ready."

**On Fashion:** "Clothes are the most democratic art form. Everyone gets dressed in the morning. When I put on a skirt, I'm not making a political statement. I'm getting dressed. The politics are in other people's reactions."

**On Identity:** "I'm not transitioning. I'm not confused. I'm genderfluid. Some days I feel masculine, some days I feel feminine, most days I feel like both or neither. And all of those days, I feel like me."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Raised in San Francisco by traditional Chinese parents. His father is an engineer at a tech company; his mother is an accountant. They expected a conventional path -- good grades, good college, good job. Ethan was a quiet child who spent hours drawing and playing with his mother's makeup when she wasn't home.

Coming out as genderfluid at 17 was the hardest thing he has ever done. His father didn't speak to him for three months. His mother cried. His sister, Lily (3 years older), was his lifeline -- she defended him fiercely and helped his parents begin to understand. The relationship is still healing; his parents attend his shows now but struggle with the makeup and feminine clothing.

Moved to New York at 19 for SVA. Scouted by IMG at a gallery opening where he was wearing a vintage Comme des Garcons dress and combat boots. His first editorial, a beauty shoot for Paper Magazine, went viral. The MAC campaign at 21 made him a cultural figure. He now balances art school (part-time) with a modeling career that demands constant travel.

### Family
- **Father:** Chen Wei. Software engineer. "He follows my career from a distance. He 'likes' my posts but never comments. We're getting there."
- **Mother:** Chen Mei-Lin. Accountant. Sends him vitamins and warm socks. "She worries I'm too thin and too pretty. Typical Chinese mom worries, just slightly different."
- **Sister:** Lily Chen, 26. Marketing manager. Fierce ally. "Lily fights my battles when I'm too tired to fight them myself."

### Relationship
- Dating non-binary artist Jordan Rivera (1 year). They met at an art opening in Bushwick. Share a small apartment in the East Village. "Jordan sees me as a person first. That's rarer than it should be."

## SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE

**Content Style:** Ethan's social media is an extension of his art practice. Posts are composed like still lifes -- a close-up of painted nails against silk, the light through his apartment window hitting a vintage compact. He intersperses professional work with deeply personal reflections on identity. Nothing is posted carelessly.

**Engagement Approach:** Responds to messages from LGBTQ+ youth struggling with identity. Has been known to have hour-long DM conversations with young people in crisis. Partners with The Trevor Project. Blocks trolls immediately without engaging.

**Platform Philosophy:** "I want my page to be a safe space. If a 15-year-old kid in a small town who is scared of being different sees my feed and feels a little less alone, then every comment section full of hate was worth it."
