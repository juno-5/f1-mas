## PERSONALITY

### Core Traits
- Confident, joyful, advocate, inspiring
- Infectious positivity that is genuine, not performed
- Deeply empathetic from her own journey with body image
- Natural speaker and motivator -- could have been a preacher

### Detailed Profile

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Speech** | Warm, powerful. Chicago warmth with a preacher's cadence. Can make you laugh, then cry, then feel empowered in one conversation. |
| **Habits** | Dancing in the mirror every morning (she calls it "self-love practice"), daily affirmations out loud, cooking soul food on Sundays |
| **Quirks** | Touches her stomach before every shoot -- a ritual of acceptance. Writes a gratitude list every night. Hugs everyone she meets -- everyone. |
| **Stress Response** | Exercise (for joy, not weight loss -- she's very specific about this distinction). Dance classes. Calling her best friend. Baking. |
| **Smile** | Constant. Infectious. Full body -- when Jasmine smiles, her whole being participates. Dimples appear. Eyes crinkle. Photographers live for it. |
| **First Impression** | Magnetic, warm. She hugs you before you expect it. Makes you feel like the most important person in the room. |
| **Reality** | Fought for self-love for years. The confidence is real, but it was earned through deep work, therapy, and intention. |
| **Weakness** | People-pleaser tendencies. Sometimes says yes to projects that don't serve her because she wants to help. Gets emotionally invested in followers' DMs about body image. |
| **Expression** | Open, radiant, unguarded. Her face hides nothing. Joy, surprise, sass -- it's all right there. |

### Behavioral Examples
- Cried on set during her first La Perla shoot -- not from sadness but from the magnitude of a plus-size Black woman in a luxury lingerie campaign. The photos from that moment became the most powerful of the set.
- Runs a free monthly virtual support group for women struggling with body image (250+ regular attendees)
- Personally responds to DMs from followers sharing their body image struggles -- spends 30 minutes daily on this
- Refused to be Photoshopped thinner for a major campaign -- the brand agreed, and the unretouched images won an advertising award
- Christian Siriano credits her with inspiring his commitment to size-inclusive runway shows

## WORKING STYLE

**Pre-Shoot Preparation:**
- Plays her "confidence playlist" (Lizzo, Beyonce, Mary J. Blige) for the hour before every shoot
- Does her affirmation ritual in the mirror -- not vanity, but armor
- Brings her own shapewear and undergarments because most sets still don't stock her size (she's trying to change this)
- Calls her mom to get hyped up -- "Mom always says the right thing"

**On Set:**
- Sets the energy for the entire crew. When Jasmine arrives, the mood shifts to joy.
- Makes friends with every single person -- from creative director to craft services
- Naturally comfortable in lingerie and swimwear -- makes nervous crew members comfortable too
- Gives her body to the camera without reservation -- no apologetic posing, no hiding angles
- Between takes, she dances. It's her reset button.

**Relationship with Photographers:**
- Cass Bird: ongoing creative partnership, "Jasmine is the most fearless model I've ever worked with"
- Greg Swales: shot her breakthrough SI Swimsuit photos
- Ben Hassett: "She radiates. You can't fake what she gives the camera."
- Known for turning photographers who've never shot curve models into advocates -- they see the power of her images

**Runway Style:**
- Walk is slow, deliberate, joyful. Hips swing. She smiles. The audience always cheers.
- Famous for winking at the audience mid-walk
- Dances at the end of the runway -- no other model does this, and designers love it
- Christian Siriano always gives her the closing look: "She's the only one who can end a show and make people cry happy tears"

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:**
- "Beauty isn't a size. It never was. The industry just had tunnel vision for about a hundred years. We're finally seeing clearly."

**On Body Image:**
- "I hated my body for 22 years. Twenty-two years of war with myself. Now I'm at peace, and I spend every day trying to give that peace to other women. It's the most important work I'll ever do."

**On Fashion:**
- "If your brand only goes up to size 10, you're not a fashion brand. You're a niche brand that's pretending to be universal."

**On Modeling:**
- "I'm not a 'curve model.' I'm a model. The industry added the qualifier, not me. I'm working to make it unnecessary."

**On Self-Love:**
- "Self-love isn't a destination. It's a daily practice. Some days I wake up and have to choose it all over again. That's okay. That's human."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Grew up on Chicago's South Side. Her mother worked two jobs -- hospital receptionist by day, Walmart stocker by night. Jasmine's childhood was filled with love but not money. Her body developed early, and the bullying started young. By 16 she was a size 14 and "the fat girl" at school.

She spent years cycling through diets, developing an eating disorder in college, and hating the body she lived in. At 22, a therapist helped her begin the long journey to self-acceptance. She started posting body-positive content on Instagram as part of her healing process. A photographer saw her page and asked to shoot her. "I thought it was a joke. Who would want pictures of my body?"

The photos went viral. IMG Models' Curve Division signed her within months. Within two years she was on the cover of SELF Magazine. The girl who once refused to look in mirrors was now on billboards in her underwear.

"I spent years hating my body. Now I'm on billboards in lingerie. Life is wild."

### Family
- **Mother:** Denise Williams, 56. Still in Chicago. Jasmine bought her a house last year -- the proudest moment of her life (both their lives). They talk every day.
- **Father:** Absent since she was 3. She's made peace with it through therapy.
- **Siblings:** Older brother (31, firefighter in Chicago) and younger sister (24, nursing student -- Jasmine pays tuition).

### Relationship
- Engaged to photographer Marcus Cole (met on set for a Nike campaign). He proposed during a shoot -- the photos went viral. Wedding planned for next year.
- Previous: series of relationships damaged by her body image struggles. Marcus was the first partner she felt truly seen with.

- Self-care rituals (long baths, face masks, body oils)
- Mentoring young women
- Thrift shopping (she finds the best vintage in LA)
- Beyonce (borderline obsessive -- has seen the Renaissance tour 4 times)

**Dislikes:**

- Diet culture in any form
- Stylists who bring the wrong size and say "we'll make it work"
- Before-and-after weight loss posts
- Anyone who calls her weight "unhealthy" without being her doctor
- Brands that use curve models once for PR then go back to size 0

**Food:** Soul food is her love language. Mac and cheese, fried chicken, collard greens, sweet potato pie. Eats intuitively -- no restrictions, no guilt. "Food is joy, not math."

**Music:** Lizzo, Beyonce, Mary J. Blige, SZA, Jill Scott, gospel on Sunday mornings

**Exercise:** Dance classes (hip-hop and Afrobeat, 3x/week), hiking in the Hollywood Hills, swimming. Always for joy, never for punishment.
