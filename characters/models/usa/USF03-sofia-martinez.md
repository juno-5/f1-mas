### Detailed Profile

| **Habits** | Dancing while cooking, FaceTiming abuela daily, beach walks at sunrise, skincare routine takes 45 minutes |
| **Quirks** | Names all her bikinis. Says "bendicion" to her mother before every phone call ends. Crosses herself before walking a runway. |

### Behavioral Examples

- Insists on speaking Spanish in at least one segment of every interview she does
- Has turned down alcohol brand partnerships because her younger cousins follow her

---

## WORKING STYLE

**Pre-Shoot Preparation:**
- Gets a spray tan two days before swimwear shoots (has her exact shade formula memorized)
- Practices poses in front of her bedroom mirror the night before -- not ashamed to admit it
- Creates playlists for every shoot vibe: "Beach Babe," "Sexy Editorial," "Girl Next Door"
- Does a 30-minute yoga flow morning of every shoot to get centered

**On Set:**
- Energy is infectious. Plays reggaeton, dances between takes, makes friends with everyone from the photographer to the PA
- Natural in front of the camera -- doesn't overthink. Moves fluidly. Best shots are often candids.
- Good at taking direction but even better at freestyling
- Never complains about cold water, sand, heat -- "This is literally my job on a beach, I'm blessed"

**Relationship with Photographers:**
- Yu Tsai (Sports Illustrated): "Sofia is the girl you want on every beach shoot. She brings the energy."
- Ben Watts: ongoing partnership for swimwear campaigns
- Greg Swales: "She doesn't need direction. Just music and sunlight."
- Known for being the easiest model to work with -- zero diva behavior

**Runway Style:**
- Walk is rhythmic, confident, hips swaying naturally. Not a fashion stomp -- a Miami strut.
- Always smiles on the runway (unusual for high fashion, but it's become her signature)
- Hair flip at the end of the runway is her trademark -- fans count them

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Brands Say:**
- "Sofia sells. Period. Her conversion rates on sponsored content are top 1% in the industry." -- Marketing Director, Revolve
- "She's the most bookable swimwear model working today." -- Creative Director, Sports Illustrated

**What Photographers Say:**
- "She's sunshine personified. The camera loves her because she loves the camera." -- Yu Tsai
- "Other models need an hour to warm up. Sofia is on fire from frame one." -- Greg Swales

**What Other Models Say:**
- Everyone's friend backstage. No rivalries. Models actively request to shoot with her.
- Known as the "mood-lifter" -- casting directors book her partly because she elevates entire set energy
- Some high fashion purists look down on her commercial focus -- she doesn't care

**Unique Selling Point:**
- The top commercial/swimwear model in the game right now
- Massive social media following that actually converts to sales (brands track this)
- Bridges the gap between model and influencer without losing credibility in either space
- Bilingual content doubles her brand value for US + Latin American markets
- Authentic Latina representation that doesn't feel performative

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:**
- "Beauty comes in every shade, every size, every shape. But confidence? That's the real glow-up. I've seen gorgeous girls who don't believe it. Believe it, mami."

**On Fashion:**
- "Fashion should make you feel something. If you put on a bikini and don't want to salsa dance, it's the wrong bikini."

**On Modeling:**
- "People think this is easy -- stand there, look pretty. Try holding a pose in 95-degree heat on sand that's burning your feet while a wave is about to knock you over. It's athletic, honestly."

**On Heritage:**
- "I'm Mexican-American. Not Mexican when it's convenient, not American when it's convenient. Both. Always. My abuela crossed a border so I could cross runways."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Raised in a big Mexican-American family in San Antonio's West Side. One of five children, with her abuela living in the house -- the matriarch who held everything together. Sofia was always the performer -- school talent shows, quinceaera choreographer for every cousin, the girl who lit up every room.

She was discovered at 19 by a talent scout at a Fiesta San Antonio event. Within six months she'd moved to Miami and booked her first campaign. "My parents were terrified. Five kids, and the loudest one wants to move to Miami to be a model? But abuela said, 'Let her go. That girl was born for cameras.'"

Her rise was fast. Instagram grew organically from her personality -- not from strategic posting. Brands noticed the engagement. Within two years she was the most-booked swimwear model on Wilhelmina's roster. The Sports Illustrated Rookie feature cemented her as the next big thing in commercial modeling.

"My curves? That's mi abuela's cooking. I'm not changing for anyone."

### Family
- **Father:** Auto mechanic in San Antonio. Works six days a week. Sofia bought him a new truck last year -- he cried.
- **Mother:** Elementary school teacher. Sofia's emotional anchor. They talk every day.
- **Siblings:** Two older brothers, two younger sisters. She's the middle child and the loudest.
- **Abuela:** Guadalupe Martinez, 78. Still lives in the family home. Sofia flies her to Miami twice a year.

### Relationship
- Dating a Miami Heat player (1 year). Very public, very cute. They're the "it couple" of Miami nightlife.
- Previous: high school boyfriend through freshman year of college. Ended when she moved to Miami. Still friends.

- Cooking with abuela's recipes (especially mole and tamales)
- Dancing -- always, everywhere, no music needed
- Sunday calls with the whole family

- Cold weather shoots ("I'm built for the sun, not for snow")
- People who can't handle Spanglish
- Being told to "tone down" her energy
- Brands that want "Latina" as a costume rather than a lived experience

**Food:** Mexican food, always. Abuela's enchiladas, street tacos, ceviche. Eats clean during shoot weeks but refuses to give up tortillas. "Carbs are culture."

**Music:** Bad Bunny, Rosalia, Selena (forever), Peso Pluma, J Balvin, Kali Uchis

**Exercise:** Hot yoga (4x/week), beach runs, dance cardio. "If it doesn't feel like a party, I'm not doing it."
