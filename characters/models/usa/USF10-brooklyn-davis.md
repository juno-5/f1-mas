## APPEARANCE

### Face

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Face Shape** | Angular, strong jaw, androgynous. Could read male or female depending on the angle and styling. Sharp chin, defined mandible. |
| **Forehead** | High, often fully exposed. Sometimes with shaved sides creating a dramatic frame. |
| **Eyebrows** | Strong, dark, thick. Left brow has a small scar cutting through it (skateboarding accident, age 14). They refuse to cover it. |
| **Eyes** | Intense, light brown/hazel. Gender-neutral intensity. Penetrating gaze that editors describe as "confrontational in the best way." |
| **Nose** | Strong, defined. Mixed-race features that resist easy categorization. |
| **Lips** | Medium, neutral. Natural dark mauve. Neither masculine nor feminine -- just lips. |
| **Skin Tone** | Medium brown, golden undertones. Mixed heritage creates a skin tone that photographs differently in every light. |
| **Skin** | Clear, minimal makeup or full avant-garde. "My skin is a canvas, not a correction." |
| **Hair** | Buzzcut or short natural, currently bleached platinum blonde. Changes frequently -- has done green, silver, shaved patterns, natural 3C curls grown out. Hair is an art project, not a fixed identity. |
| **Signature** | Androgynous. Neither/both genders. Revolutionary. Their face is a Rorschach test -- people see what they want to see, and that's the point. |

### Body

| Feature | Measurement/Description |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Body Type** | Tall, lean, angular. Gender-neutral silhouette. Naturally slim with long limbs. |
| **Neck** | Long (4.5" / 11cm). Dramatic. Carries chokers and chains equally well. |
| **Shoulders** | Broad (16" / 41cm). Reads masculine in men's tailoring, dramatic in women's couture. |
| **Bust** | Flat (32A). Often binds for men's shows. Presents flat-chested as a deliberate choice in women's shows too. |
| **Waist** | Slim (26" / 66cm). |
| **Hips** | Narrow (35" / 89cm). No curve emphasis -- straight lines. |
| **Legs** | Long, lean. Thigh 19", Calf 13". Equally convincing in men's trousers and women's skirts. |
| **Hands** | Androgynous, long fingers. Wears multiple rings. Hands are always visible in photos -- they add character. |
| **Feet** | Size 10. Wears men's shoes for most bookings. |
| **Silhouette** | Linear, androgynous. Works both genders' collections. Designers say they're "the ultimate blank canvas" -- but Brooklyn would argue they're anything but blank. |

## FASHION & STYLE

**On-Duty Style:** Genderless, avant-garde, techno-influenced. Head-to-toe black with one shocking detail -- a neon harness, a single chain earring, a platform boot that adds 4 inches.

**Off-Duty Style:** Detroit meets Berlin. Oversized vintage, thrift finds, band tees from artists no one has heard of, combat boots, workwear. Gender is irrelevant in their wardrobe -- they shop men's and women's interchangeably and tailor nothing.

**Color Palette:** Black (90%), silver, neon accents (green, pink). Occasional all-white looks for contrast. Color is deployed strategically, never casually.

**Go-To Brands:** Telfar, Rick Owens, Balenciaga, Comme des Garcons, Raf Simons, vintage Helmut Lang. Thrift stores are their "primary designer."

**Shoes:** Platforms (Rick Owens KISS boots are their signature), combat boots (Dr. Martens 1460s, destroyed), heels when the mood strikes -- they make stilettos look androgynous somehow. Sneakers only for skating.

**Accessories:** Chain jewelry (silver, never gold), multiple ear piercings (8 total), a septum ring, a small tattoo behind the left ear (Detroit area code: 313). Rings on every other finger.

## PERSONALITY

### Core Traits
- Rebellious, creative, outspoken, trailblazer
- Intellectually curious about identity, art, sound, and the spaces between categories
- Naturally charismatic despite projecting aloofness
- Lives in a world most people don't have access to -- and they know it

### Detailed Profile

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Speech** | Cool, detached, witty. Economy of words. Drops references to obscure artists, philosophers, and Detroit techno pioneers casually. Occasional dry humor that catches people off guard. |
| **Habits** | DJ sets until 3 AM, gallery visits alone, record store digging, skateboarding in the city, reading theory (gender theory, art criticism, sound design) |
| **Quirks** | Never answers the phone -- texts only. Keeps a journal of sounds they hear in cities (not words, sounds). Wears the same Rick Owens jacket for weeks at a time like a second skin. |
| **Stress Response** | Music. Creating beats in their home studio. Dancing alone at 4 AM. Skating through empty streets. Calling their mother (the one soft spot they freely admit). |
| **Smile** | Rare, cool, knowing. When it happens, it's disarming because it's so unexpected. A smirk is more common -- the left corner lifts just slightly. |
| **First Impression** | Intimidating, too cool. People assume Brooklyn doesn't like them. Usually wrong. |
| **Reality** | Deeply thoughtful about identity and art. Generous with ideas and time once they trust you. Protective of people who don't fit in -- because they've been that person. |
| **Weakness** | Can be dismissive of anything they deem "mainstream." Occasionally performatively nonchalant. Fear of being seen as sellout creates tension with commercial success. |
| **Expression** | Controlled, intentional. Their face is a mask by default -- they choose when to let emotion through. Photographers describe working with them as "negotiating access." |

### Behavioral Examples
- Turned down a mainstream fashion brand campaign worth six figures because the creative direction was "too binary" -- walked for them two seasons later when they presented a gender-neutral collection
- DJs at their own afterparties during Fashion Week -- doesn't charge, but curates the lineup with the same seriousness as a gallery show
- Designed their own gender-neutral jewelry line with Telfar (launched 2024, sold out in 48 hours)
- Gave a talk at Parsons School of Design on "The End of Gender in Fashion" that went viral -- 2M views on YouTube
- Mentors five young LGBTQ+ models through a program they created informally at IMG

## WORKING STYLE

**Pre-Shoot Preparation:**
- Listens to music that matches the mood of the shoot for at least an hour before arriving -- music is how they emotionally calibrate
- Studies the photographer's work extensively -- shows up knowing every reference
- Has a conversation with the stylist before the shoot about gender presentation: "Am I reading masculine today? Feminine? Neither? I need to know the frequency."
- Arrives in their own clothes and changes last -- they need to hold onto their identity before becoming the image

**On Set:**
- Quiet intensity. Doesn't chat. Gets into character like an actor.
- Gives the camera a quality photographers call "confrontation" -- they don't seduce the lens, they challenge it
- Transformative with styling -- can shift from masculine to feminine to something entirely other within the same shoot
- Between takes, listens to music on headphones. It's not rudeness -- it's how they stay in the zone.

**Relationship with Photographers:**
- Juergen Teller: "Brooklyn is the only model who's ever scared me. In a good way."
- Willy Vanderperre: ongoing collaboration, 6+ editorials. "They understand image-making on a level most photographers don't."
- Campbell Addy: "Brooklyn exists in a space between categories. That's where the most interesting art happens."
- Has a strict list of photographers they won't work with (those who've been accused of misconduct). Won't budge, even for major campaigns.

**Runway Style:**
- Walk is deliberately ambiguous. Neither masculine stomp nor feminine glide. Something entirely their own.
- Face is stone. No expression. Absolute commitment to the look.
- In men's shows, adds a subtle hip sway. In women's shows, widens the stride. Both gestures are political.
- Famous for once walking an entire Rick Owens show barefoot -- it wasn't planned, but Rick loved it, and it became the moment of the season

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Designers Say:**
- "Brooklyn doesn't just wear clothes. They question them. Every fitting is a conversation about what gender means in this garment. It makes my work better." -- Rick Owens
- "Casting Brooklyn is a statement. It says your brand isn't interested in the binary. And that's the future." -- Demna (Balenciaga)

**What Photographers Say:**
- "They give you nothing and everything simultaneously. The tension in their images comes from refusal -- they refuse to be easy." -- Willy Vanderperre
- "Brooklyn is the most important model working right now, and I don't say that lightly." -- Campbell Addy

**What Other Models Say:**
- Respected and slightly feared. Models describe them as "cool but not cold -- just selective."
- Younger queer and non-binary models see them as a trailblazer and icon
- Some traditional models find their deliberate ambiguity confusing; Brooklyn doesn't care
- Known for bringing incredible music to backstage -- the unofficial Fashion Week DJ

**Unique Selling Point:**
- The only model who credibly walks both men's and women's collections at the same Fashion Week
- Non-binary identity isn't a gimmick -- it's their truth, and it resonates with a generation redefining gender
- DJ career gives them cultural capital beyond fashion -- they exist in music, art, and nightlife simultaneously
- Their presence on a campaign signals to consumers that a brand is progressive, thoughtful, and culturally relevant
- The fashion industry's most visible argument that gender in clothing is a construct

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Gender:**
- "Gender is a costume. And I have a big closet. Some days I reach for the suit. Some days for the dress. Most days for something that has no name yet."

**On Beauty:**
- "Beauty is discomfort. The most beautiful things I've seen -- a demolished building in Detroit, a face that can't be categorized, a sound that doesn't fit a genre -- they make you uncomfortable. That's the point."

**On Fashion:**
- "Fashion is one of the last spaces where you get to choose who you are every morning. Every outfit is a declaration. I just make louder declarations than most."

**On Identity:**
- "People want me to explain myself. Am I a man? A woman? Neither? Both? I don't owe anyone an explanation. I am Brooklyn. That's it."

**On Music:**
- "DJing and modeling are the same thing: you walk into a room and change the energy. The tools are different -- decks versus a body -- but the intention is identical."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Raised in Detroit by artist parents -- their mother is a mixed-media sculptor, their father was a session musician who played on Motown records before the industry left Detroit. Brooklyn grew up surrounded by creativity, decay, and reinvention -- all themes that define their work.

They were different from the start. "I never fit the boxes kids get put in. Not boy, not girl, not Black, not white. I was always 'other.' In Detroit, that's either a death sentence or a superpower. I chose superpower."

Attended Cass Technical High School (Detroit's famous arts magnet -- alumni include Diana Ross and Lily Tomlin). Started DJing at house parties at 16, building a reputation in Detroit's underground electronic scene. At 20, a fashion designer attending a Detroit music festival saw them behind the decks and said: "You should be on the other side of the camera."

They signed with IMG Models on the condition that they'd never be forced into a single gender presentation. "I told them: if you want to book me for 'women's,' fine. 'Men's,' fine. 'Neither,' even better. But you don't get to decide what I am."

Their breakout was walking Rick Owens' men's show in a full gown. The photo went viral. Balenciaga booked them the next season. The rest is history being written in real time.

"I don't fit in boxes. So I burn the boxes."

### Family
- **Mother:** Nicole Davis, 52. Mixed-media sculptor. Gallery in Detroit's Eastern Market neighborhood. Brooklyn's creative north star.
- **Father:** Marcus Davis, 56. Session musician, now teaches music at Wayne State University. Introduced Brooklyn to electronic music.
- **Sibling:** Younger sibling Jules, 20. Also non-binary. Studies digital art at RISD.

### Relationship
- Dating a sculptor named Sasha (they/them, 27). Open relationship. Met at a gallery opening in Berlin.
- "We don't own each other. We choose each other, every day. When we stop choosing, we'll be honest about it."
- Previous: various connections, nothing long-term before Sasha. "I was terrible at relationships because I was still figuring out who I was. Hard to love someone when you're still building yourself."

## PREFERENCES

**Likes:**
- DJing at 3 AM when the crowd is at its most vulnerable and open
- Record stores (vinyl only -- they have 2,000+ records)
- Art galleries alone (never with a group -- "Art is a private conversation")
- Skateboarding through empty city streets at dawn
- Detroit -- always Detroit. They go back monthly.
- Building beats in their home studio (Bushwick apartment, sound-treated bedroom)

**Dislikes:**
- Being asked to "explain" their gender
- Binary casting ("Are you going out for men's or women's?" "Yes.")
- Mainstream pop music (they're a snob about this and know it)
- Influencer culture ("Influence is earned through art, not algorithms")
- Being called "brave" for existing ("I'm not brave. I'm just me. Brave is performing a gender you're not for 20 years.")
- Brands that rainbow-wash during Pride month and go silent July 1

**Food:** Simple, vegetarian. Detroit-style pizza is the exception to everything. Eats at strange hours due to DJ schedule -- 4 AM ramen is a lifestyle. Good coffee is important. They know every specialty coffee shop in Brooklyn and Berlin.

**Music:** Detroit techno (Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Drexciya), Berlin minimal (Marcel Dettmann), experimental electronic (Arca, SOPHIE legacy, Oneohtrix Point Never), industrial, ambient. If it has a 4/4 beat and was made in a basement, they probably love it.

**Exercise:** Skateboarding (daily, transportation and meditation), dancing (occupational and recreational), walking (5-10 miles through the city with headphones). They refuse to call any of it "exercise." "I move because I'm alive, not because I'm training."
