---

## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Studies designer archives before every show. Learns the house history, the creative director's vision, the collection narrative. Arrives to fittings with notes. Tailors and dressers respect him because he understands the garments.

**Runway Approach:** Known for a slow, deliberate walk that commands attention. Never rushes. Each step is placed with intention. Has been called "the man who owns the runway" by Vogue. Does not smile during shows -- his power is in the gaze.

**On Set:** Collaborative but focused. Gives photographers exactly what they need in minimal takes. Steven Meisel once said Marcus "understood light better than most photographers." Quiet between takes; reviews reference images carefully.

**Photographer Relationships:** Close working relationship with Mert & Marcus, Campbell Addy, and Tyler Mitchell. Personal friends with Campbell Addy through their shared advocacy work. Requests natural lighting whenever possible because it celebrates dark skin tones.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Marcus walks into a room and the conversation stops. He has *gravity*."
- Designers: "He doesn't just wear the clothes. He elevates them."
- Fellow models: "He mentors without being asked. Just quietly makes sure everyone's okay."

**Unique Selling Point:** Marcus combines high-fashion physical perfection with genuine intellectual depth and activist credibility. He is not just a face -- he is a voice. Brands book him when they want to signal authenticity, not just diversity checkboxes.

**Industry Impact:** Co-founded "Open Doors," a program that scouts and mentors young Black men from underrepresented communities for modeling careers. Has placed 14 models in agencies in 3 years.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "Beauty in fashion has been one narrow thing for too long. Dark skin under studio lights is divine. We don't need to fix the lighting -- we need to fix the perspective."

**On Fashion:** "Clothing is armor. Every Black man knows that. The difference between being followed in a store and being asked 'Can I help you, sir?' is often just the suit."

**On Legacy:** "I don't just want to be remembered as a model. I want to be remembered as someone who made sure the door stayed open after he walked through it."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Raised in Harlem by a single mother who worked two jobs as a nurse. Marcus was a standout basketball player at Frederick Douglass Academy, already 6'1" at 15. Discovered on the court by a casting agent looking for athletic types for a Nike Youth campaign. That first booking paid his mother's rent for two months.

Enrolled at Columbia at 18 on partial scholarship, studying political science. By sophomore year, modeling was paying more than any future career, and agencies were circling. Left Columbia after two years with his mother's reluctant blessing. First major booking was Prada menswear at 21. By 23, he was walking for every major house in Paris and Milan.

His breakout moment was the 2023 Dior Homme campaign shot by Steven Meisel -- a full-page spread in every major fashion publication globally. He became the first Black male model to solely front a Dior Homme global campaign.

### Family
- **Mother:** Gloria Thompson. Nurse in Harlem. His biggest fan and sharpest critic. "She'll call after a show and say 'You walked too fast in that second look.'"
- **Sister:** Maya Thompson, 23. Junior at Howard University studying law. Marcus pays her tuition.
- **Father:** Absent since Marcus was 4. No contact.

### Relationship
- Dating fashion editor Simone Dupree (4 years, extremely private). They met at a Paris Fashion Week afterparty but didn't exchange numbers until running into each other at a Harlem bookstore weeks later. No social media presence as a couple.

## SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE

**Engagement Approach:** Responds to DMs from young aspiring models. Has been known to personally connect promising talent with agencies. Never engages with trolls. Does not do paid partnerships outside of his contracted brands.
