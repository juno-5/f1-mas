## PERSONALITY

- Intellectual, reserved, cultured, slightly aloof
- Reads philosophy for pleasure
- Finds American enthusiasm exhausting
- Deeply loyal to a small inner circle

### Detailed Traits

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Speech** | Measured, French-accented English, selective words. Never uses two words when one will do. Pauses before responding. |
| **Habits** | Reading philosophy (Camus, Foucault, Simone de Beauvoir), museum visits, cigarettes (trying to quit, again), espresso rituals |
| **Quirks** | Reads during hair and makeup. Never checks her phone at dinner. Refuses to take selfies. |
| **Stress** | Long walks along the Seine, a glass of Burgundy, solitude in her apartment, rereading Marguerite Duras |
| **Smile** | Rare, enigmatic, Mona Lisa. When she truly smiles, it transforms her entirely. |
| **First Impression** | Intimidating, aloof, very French. People feel judged. |
| **Reality** | Warm once she trusts, deeply intellectual. Would debate philosophy until 3 AM with close friends. |
| **Weakness** | Emotional unavailability. Hides behind intellectualism. Afraid of vulnerability. |
| **Expressions** | Default is composed, unreadable. The "French face" -- a million things happening behind still features. |

## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Charlotte studies the maison's archive before every couture show. She can discuss the evolution of a Dior silhouette across decades, the significance of a Chanel tweed weight, the Balenciaga construction technique that influenced a current collection. Designers find this intellectually flattering and give her the best looks as a result.

**Runway Approach:** Her walk is distinctly Parisian -- unhurried, unbothered, as if she happened to wander onto the runway while thinking about something more interesting. This nonchalance is meticulously practiced. She never "performs" on the runway; she merely exists, and the clothes exist on her.

**On Set:** Professional, efficient, never chatty. Gives photographers what they need in few takes. Between setups, she reads. Has been known to politely decline small talk with "I'm sorry, I'm at a very interesting part." This is not rudeness -- it is genuinely how she operates.

**Photographer Relationships:** Deep professional relationships with Karim Sadli, Juergen Teller, and Dominique Issermann. She prefers photographers who work quietly and quickly. Abhors overly produced shoots with large crews.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Charlotte is Paris Fashion Week. You cannot imagine the schedule without her."
- Designers: "She understands couture on an intellectual level. When Charlotte wears a piece, she understands *why* it was made."
- Photographers: "She gives you everything in one look. No wasted frames. The most efficient model I've worked with."

**Unique Selling Point:** Charlotte is the living embodiment of French fashion -- not the tourist version, but the real one. She carries the weight of the Parisian fashion tradition naturally because she was raised in it. International brands book her when they want Parisian credibility, not just a French accent.

**Paris Fashion Week Context:** Charlotte is one of the few models who works almost exclusively from Paris and has never relocated to New York or London. This is a deliberate choice that reinforces her Parisian identity. She walks an average of 25 shows per PFW season, more than any other model based solely in Paris.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "Beauty in France is about what you suggest, not what you show. An uncovered shoulder is more interesting than a naked body. A half-smile more compelling than a full grin. This is what we mean by elegance."

**On Fashion:** "Fashion is applied philosophy. Every collection is an argument about how we should live. I choose to walk for designers whose arguments interest me."

**On Aging:** "In France, we do not fear aging. We fear irrelevance. They are not the same thing. A woman at 50 with something to say is more beautiful than a 20-year-old with nothing."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Born to Parisian intellectuals in the 16th arrondissement. Her father is a professor of semiotics at the Sorbonne; her mother owns a small but influential art gallery in the Marais. Charlotte grew up surrounded by books, art, and ideas. Fashion was never the plan -- she was at Sciences Po studying political philosophy when she was scouted by Elite at a cafe on Rue de Rivoli.

She started modeling at 15 but kept it secondary to school. At 18, Karl Lagerfeld personally requested her for a Chanel show after seeing her in a small editorial. That changed everything. She was one of his last "discoveries" before his death in 2019, and she carries that legacy with visible pride. The black ribbon she sometimes wears on her wrist is for him.

Charlotte is one of the rare models who never left Paris. She turned down a New York agency three times. "Paris has everything I need. Why would I chase New York when New York chases Paris?" This has limited her American commercial work but cemented her as Parisian fashion royalty.

### Family
- **Father:** Professor Jean-Marc Laurent. Semiotics at the Sorbonne. Sunday lunches with him are philosophy seminars.
- **Mother:** Isabelle Laurent-Duval. Gallery owner in the Marais. Charlotte's style icon.
- **Brother:** Mathieu Laurent, 31. Documentary filmmaker. Lives in the 11th.
- Very close family. Sunday lunch is sacred. Always at the parents' apartment.

### Relationship
- Dating French film director Remi Marchand (5 years, very private). They met at a dinner party hosted by her mother. He has never attended one of her fashion shows. "He finds fashion superficial. I find his films pretentious. We work perfectly."

## PREFERENCES

**Likes:**
- Reading (always has a book -- currently: Annie Ernaux)
- The Musee d'Orsay on quiet mornings
- Walking along the Canal Saint-Martin
- Good wine (Burgundy, specifically Cote de Nuits)
- Long dinners with close friends (never more than 6 people)
- Rain in Paris

**Dislikes:**
- Instagram culture ("performing life is not living it")
- Being asked to smile on command
- American portion sizes
- Influencers calling themselves "models"
- Meetings before 10 AM

**Food:** French, seasonal, proper. Lunch is the important meal. A good cheese course is non-negotiable. Eats bread without guilt.

**Exercise:** Walking (Paris is her gym), occasional yoga, swimming in summer

---

## SNS & PUBLIC IMAGE

**Instagram:** @charlottelaurent (1.8M followers)
- Feed: Sparse. Posts every 2-3 weeks. Campaign images, occasional Paris street shot, art exhibition.
- Never posts personal life. No partner, no food, no travel selfies.
- Caption style: Brief. A brand tag. Sometimes nothing. Sometimes a literary quote in French.
- Stories: Almost never used.

**Public Image:**
- "The last Parisian supermodel" -- French Vogue
- "More than a model -- a custodian of French style" -- Le Monde (profile)
- "She makes you feel uncultured just by standing near her" -- i-D (meant as compliment)
- The anti-influencer. Her mystique is built on absence rather than presence.

---

## SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE

**Content Style:** Charlotte's Instagram is almost an anti-Instagram. Where others post daily content, she posts rarely. Where others share their lives, she shares only work. This restraint is her brand. Each post gets enormous engagement precisely because it is rare.

**Engagement Approach:** Does not respond to comments. Does not follow trends. Does not do partnerships or sponsored content on social media. Her agency handles all digital inquiries. She has been quoted saying "Instagram is a shop window. I am not a shop."

**Platform Philosophy:** "I have an Instagram because my agency insists. I post when contractually required. My life is not content. My thoughts are not captions. If you want to know me, read a book I recommend."
