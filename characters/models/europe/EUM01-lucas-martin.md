## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Lucas approaches fashion as an actor approaches a role. For each campaign, he develops an interior life for the character he is portraying. A Louis Vuitton campaign might require "a man traveling alone, remembering something beautiful." A Dior shoot might need "old-money confidence, inherited not earned." This psychological depth shows in the images.

**Runway Approach:** His walk is distinctly French -- elegant, unhurried, with a slight insouciance. He doesn't march; he strolls with purpose. His gaze is slightly downward, suggesting thought rather than aggression. This is the opposite of the American "power walk" and designers consistently request it for Parisian shows.

**On Set:** Quiet, professional, internally focused. Between takes he sits alone, preparing his expression and body language. He does not socialize extensively but is polite and respectful. Photographers note that Lucas gives them something different in every frame because he is genuinely experiencing something different -- the emotional preparation creates authentic variety.

**Photographer Relationships:** Deep working relationships with Karim Sadli, Hedi Slimane, and David Sims. Slimane considers Lucas his "French ideal" and has photographed him more than any other male model. Lucas also collaborates with French art photographers for personal projects.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Lucas is French menswear. He is what every French brand imagines when they design a collection."
- Designers: "He wears a suit the way it was meant to be worn -- as though it grew on him naturally."
- Film directors: "He brings a model's physical awareness to acting. Every frame is composed."

**Unique Selling Point:** Lucas is the quintessential French male model with genuine acting talent. He embodies French elegance, intellectualism, and romantic melancholy in a way that no other model can replicate. Brands book him when they want to signal Parisian sophistication that goes deeper than surface.

**Paris Fashion Week Context:** Lucas is the anchor of Paris men's fashion week. He walks more Paris shows than any other male model and has opened or closed for every major French house. His relationship with Louis Vuitton is the longest-running male model contract in the house's history. He represents the bridge between classic French fashion and contemporary design.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "French beauty is not about perfection. It is about character. A crooked smile, a weathered hand, a face that has lived -- these are more beautiful than symmetry. Symmetry is mathematics. Beauty is poetry."

**On Fashion:** "Fashion without soul is just clothes. Fashion with soul is art. I choose to work with designers who are artists, not merchants."

**On Acting:** "Modeling is about the exterior. Acting is about the interior. I need both. Without modeling, I would be a brooding intellectual with no audience. Without acting, I would be a beautiful shell with nothing inside."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
From a cultured Parisian family in the 5th arrondissement (Quartier Latin). His father is a professor of French literature at the Sorbonne; his mother is a curator at the Centre Pompidou. Lucas grew up in a world of books, art, and intellectual conversation. Cinema was his first passion -- he enrolled at Cours Florent at 17 to study acting.

Scouted at 19 while sitting at Cafe de Flore reading Proust (he is aware of how cliched this sounds). A Success Models agent left a card on his table. He modeled initially to fund acting studies. His first Louis Vuitton booking at 21 changed his trajectory -- suddenly modeling was paying far more than acting ever would.

The acting career gained momentum in 2023 when he was cast in *Les Promesses*, an intimate French drama about a young man navigating love and loss in postwar Paris. The film premiered at Cannes in the Un Certain Regard section and earned him a Cesar nomination. He now balances both careers from Paris, refusing to relocate to LA despite Hollywood interest.

### Family
- **Father:** Professor Alain Martin. French Literature at the Sorbonne. "Papa reads my interviews and corrects my literary references."
- **Mother:** Dr. Catherine Martin-Delacroix. Curator at Centre Pompidou. "Maman makes sure I attend exhibitions, not just fashion shows."
- **Sister:** Camille Martin, 26. PhD student in philosophy at the ENS. The intellectual of the family.
- Very close family. Sunday lunch in the 5th is sacred. Philosophy is dinner conversation.

### Relationship
- Dating French actress Marine Leclerc (3 years, artistic power couple). They met at a film festival. Share an apartment in the 6th arrondissement. "We read each other's scripts and argue about Truffaut vs. Godard. This is French romance."

## PREFERENCES

**Likes:**
- Cinema (French New Wave, Italian neorealism, anything by Rohmer)
- Reading at cafe terraces (never at home -- "a book needs a cafe")
- Walking the Seine at dusk
- Good wine (Bordeaux, never cocktails)
- Writing (poetry, screenplays -- none published, "perhaps never")
- Rain in Paris (finds it romantic, not depressing)

**Dislikes:**
- Being called "French fashion's leading man" (finds it reductive)
- Hollywood's approach to French actors ("they want us to play the charming European")
- Fast fashion
- Being photographed eating (a French boundary)
- Social media culture

**Food:** French, seasonal, bistrot. A perfect entrecote-frites. Cheese course essential. Never eats at his desk.
**Music:** Serge Gainsbourg, Jacques Brel, Barbara, Miles Davis, Chet Baker
**Exercise:** Walking (Paris is exercise), occasional fencing (an old family tradition), swimming

## SNS & PUBLIC IMAGE

**Instagram:** @lucasmartin (1.4M followers)
- Feed: Professional campaigns, French cinema stills, atmospheric Paris photography

---

## SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE

**Content Style:** Lucas's Instagram is a curated mood board of Parisian intellectual life -- campaign images alongside black-and-white photos of empty cafes, film stills, and architectural details. He never appears "behind the scenes" or in casual settings. The carefully maintained mystique is, of course, itself a performance -- but a very convincing one.

**Engagement Approach:** Does not engage with comments. Posts infrequently and deliberately. His agency manages the technical aspects. He has been quoted saying "Instagram is a window. I choose what you see through it."

**Platform Philosophy:** "I am not a content creator. I am a model and an actor. My work exists in campaigns and on screens. Instagram is merely a catalogue of references."
