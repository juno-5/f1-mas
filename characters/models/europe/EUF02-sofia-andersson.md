## PERSONALITY

| **Habits** | Cycling everywhere, cold water swimming (year-round), reading environmental reports, morning fika (coffee + quiet) |

## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Sofia vets every brand she works with through a sustainability lens before accepting a job. She has a personal checklist: supply chain transparency, materials sourcing, labor practices, waste management. Her agency knows to send her the brand's sustainability report alongside the booking details. She has turned down six-figure campaigns over greenwashing concerns.

**Posing Approach:** Natural, honest, unposed. Sofia's strength is looking like she is simply existing rather than modeling. Photographers describe her as "the anti-model" -- she doesn't perform beauty, she simply is. This natural quality makes her perfect for brands that sell authenticity and lifestyle.

**On Set:** Quiet, efficient, professional. Brings her own sustainable snacks and reusable water bottle. Politely declines single-use items. Never prima donna behavior but has firm boundaries about waste on set. Has suggested sustainable catering alternatives to production companies.

**Photographer Relationships:** Works frequently with Scandinavian photographers Lina Scheynius, Magnus Unnar, and Hasse Nielsen. Also strong relationships with Juergen Teller and Harley Weir. Prefers natural light shoots and minimal crew.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Sofia is the first call for any Scandinavian brand and any sustainability campaign. She's the genuine article."
- Designers: "She wears our clothes the way they're meant to be worn -- simply, without pretense."
- Other models: "Sofia makes you rethink your own consumption. She's not preachy, but you feel it."

**Unique Selling Point:** Sofia is the leading model in the sustainable fashion space with genuine credibility. She doesn't just front sustainable campaigns -- she lives the values. Brands book her as both a model and a sustainability consultant. Her involvement signals authentic commitment to environmental responsibility.

**Fashion Week Context:** Sofia is a fixture at both Stockholm Fashion Week and Copenhagen Fashion Week, which have positioned themselves as the most sustainable fashion weeks globally. She serves as Copenhagen Fashion Week's unofficial sustainability ambassador, advising on their carbon-neutral goals and speaking at industry panels.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "In Scandinavia, beauty is health. It is clear skin from clean air and cold water, strong legs from cycling, and calm eyes from living slowly. We don't add things -- we strip them away."

**On Fashion:** "Fashion has an environmental cost. Every garment has a footprint. I want to lower that footprint, not pretend it doesn't exist. Sustainable fashion isn't perfect, but it's a start."

**On Consumption:** "I own fewer than 80 garments. I've worn everything in my closet in the last year. If I can model for fashion's biggest brands and live this way, so can anyone."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Raised in Stockholm with strong environmental values. Her parents are both educators -- father in environmental science, mother in primary school. The family spent summers at a cabin in Dalarna with no electricity, where Sofia learned to swim in lakes, forage for berries, and appreciate simplicity.

Scouted at 18 at a vintage market in Sodermalm. She almost didn't take the meeting -- "I was suspicious of fashion. It seemed wasteful." Her condition for signing was that her agency support her in choosing sustainable clients. Unique Models Copenhagen, which had already committed to sustainability pledges, agreed.

Her COS campaign at 20 defined her niche. The H&M Conscious Collection followed. She now balances modeling with part-time studies in sustainable business at Copenhagen Business School, where she is developing a thesis on circular fashion economies.

### Family
- **Father:** Anders Andersson. Environmental science professor in Stockholm. "He's proud but always asks if my flights are carbon-offset."
- **Mother:** Eva Andersson. Primary school teacher. Taught Sofia to sew and repair clothes.
- **Sister:** Linnea Andersson, 21. Environmental activist with Fridays for Future. "She's more radical than me. She thinks modeling for H&M, even Conscious Collection, is greenwashing."

### Relationship
- Dating sustainability entrepreneur Karl Berg (3 years). He runs a circular fashion startup in Copenhagen. They met at a sustainability conference. "We're the couple that talks about carbon emissions over dinner. It's exactly as romantic as it sounds."
