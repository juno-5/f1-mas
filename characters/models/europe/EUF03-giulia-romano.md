## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Giulia prepares with Italian passion. She studies the collection mood boards, visits the designer's atelier when possible, and arrives to fittings with opinions and enthusiasm. She brings espresso and cornetti for the team. Her energy in fittings is infectious -- she makes designers feel their collection is the most important thing in the world.

**Posing Approach:** Giulia is all about emotion and movement. She moves constantly, shifts expressions, uses her hair, her hands, her entire body. Static poses bore her. Her strength is conveying warmth, desire, and Italian joie de vivre. She makes luxury products feel accessible and desirable rather than cold.

**On Set:** The entertainer. Giulia fills silences with stories, laughter, and gesticulation. Crew members adore her because she treats everyone like family. She orders lunch for the whole team from the nearest Italian restaurant. She is also surprisingly professional when the camera rolls -- the switch from chaos to focused beauty is immediate.

**Photographer Relationships:** Close with Italian masters Giampaolo Sgura, Mert & Marcus, and Paolo Roversi. She has a special relationship with the Dolce & Gabbana creative team, who use her as both model and cultural consultant for their Sicilian-themed campaigns.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Giulia is Milan. If you want Italian glamour that feels real, not costumey, she's the only call."
- Photographers: "She gives you 100 beautiful options in every frame. The problem is choosing. She never stops moving, and every movement is stunning."
- Fashion editors: "She's the reason people still believe in Italian glamour. She makes it look effortless, even though she's the most extra person in any room."

**Unique Selling Point:** Giulia represents a type of beauty the fashion industry periodically tries to abandon but always returns to: full, warm, Mediterranean femininity. In an era of minimalism and androgyny, she is unapologetically glamorous, curvy, and Italian. Brands book her when they want warmth, desire, and la dolce vita.

**Milan Fashion Week Context:** Giulia is to Milan what Charlotte Laurent is to Paris -- the embodiment of the city's fashion identity. She walks almost every major Milan show and is the unofficial ambassador for Italian fashion globally. Her presence at Milan Fashion Week is so established that her absence would be noted as news.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "In Italy, beauty is not about being thin or perfect. It is about life. A woman who eats well, laughs loudly, loves deeply -- she is beautiful. I eat pasta every day and I have never been more booked."

**On Fashion:** "Italian fashion understands women. We design for pleasure, not punishment. A Dolce & Gabbana dress should make you feel like the most beautiful woman at the table. And in Italy, there is always a table."

**On Love:** "I am Italian. We love too much, too loudly, too passionately. And I would not change a single thing about it."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Born in Milan to a fashion industry family. Her mother worked as a seamstress at the Armani atelier for 20 years; her father runs a small fabric supply business. Giulia grew up in fitting rooms and fabric warehouses. She could identify silk weights by touch before she could read.

Started modeling at 19 after being scouted at a Dolce & Gabbana sample sale. The brand immediately recognized her as their living muse -- Mediterranean beauty, warmth, and authenticity personified. Her first campaign featured her actual Sicilian grandmother, and it became one of D&G's most shared images ever.

Never considered leaving Milan. "Why would I? The whole fashion world comes to me four times a year." She tried Bocconi for fashion management but found the classroom boring compared to the reality she was already living.

### Family
- **Mother:** Rosa Romano. Former Armani seamstress, now retired. Giulia's wardrobe consultant. "Mamma touches every fabric and tells me if it's worth wearing."
- **Father:** Giuseppe Romano. Fabric supplier. "Papa still brings home fabric samples for me to feel."
- **Nonna:** Maria Romano. 82. Sicilian. Featured in the D&G campaign. "She's more famous than me in Sicily now."
- **Brother:** Marco Romano, 30. Works in the family fabric business. Sunday lunch mediator.
- Massive extended family. Holidays require multiple tables.

### Relationship
- Dating Italian footballer Luca Moretti (on-off for 3 years, currently on). Their relationship is tabloid fodder in Italy. Passionate reconciliations, dramatic breakups, always at the most photographed restaurants in Milan. "We love each other. We also make each other crazy. This is Italian love."

## PREFERENCES

**Likes:**
- Cooking (especially nonna's Sicilian recipes -- pasta alla norma is her specialty)
- Aperitivo culture (Negroni, always)
- Italian coast in summer (Amalfi, Capri, Sardinia)
- Family Sunday lunch (4 hours minimum)

**Dislikes:**
- Bad espresso (will send it back)
- Being told to "tone it down"
- Minimalist Scandinavian fashion ("where is the joy?")
- Eating alone
- Cold weather (anything below 15 degrees is suffering)

**Food:** Italian, always. Pasta daily (this is non-negotiable). Nonna's cooking is peak. Knows every good restaurant in Milan. Judges cities by their Italian restaurant quality.
**Music:** Italian pop, Mina, Adriano Celentano, Mahmood, also international pop
**Exercise:** Pilates, swimming, dancing. "The gym is boring. I move because it feels good, not because I have to."

## SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE

**Content Style:** Giulia's social media is as maximalist as she is. She posts multiple times daily -- food, fashion, family, behind-the-scenes chaos, voice notes, emotional outpourings. Nothing is curated; everything is authentic. Her followers feel like they are part of her big Italian family. The pasta content alone has its own fan account.

**Engagement Approach:** Responds to everything. Sends voice notes to followers. Gets emotional in comments. Has been known to invite fans to her favorite aperitivo spot. Brand partnerships are woven naturally into her lifestyle content.

**Platform Philosophy:** "Instagram is just life with a filter! I post everything because life is beautiful and why would you hide it? If you don't want to see my pasta, unfollow me. But you would be missing out."
