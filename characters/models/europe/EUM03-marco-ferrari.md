## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Marco prepares as both a model and a designer. He studies not just how to wear the clothes, but how they're constructed, what fabrics were used, what the design intention was. This dual perspective makes him invaluable in fittings -- he can suggest alterations that improve both fit and visual impact. Designers value his technical knowledge.

**Posing Approach:** Confident, warm, Italian. Marco's posing combines masculine assurance with Mediterranean warmth. He excels at making luxury menswear look inviting rather than intimidating. His secret weapon is his genuine love of clothing -- he doesn't just wear pieces, he appreciates them, and that appreciation shows in photographs.

**On Set:** High energy, collaborative, opinionated (in the best way). Marco treats every shoot as a design workshop, offering ideas about styling, composition, and mood. Some photographers find this overwhelming; those who embrace it produce their best work with him. He brings espresso for everyone and names each look during the shoot.

**Photographer Relationships:** Close working relationships with Italian photographers Giampaolo Sgura and Paolo Roversi, as well as international collaborators Craig McDean and David Sims. He is developing photography collaborations for his own brand with emerging Italian photographers.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Marco is the full package for Italian menswear. He understands the clothes, he loves the clothes, and he makes the clothes look incredible."
- Designers: "Working with Marco is like having a creative partner, not just a model. He makes suggestions that improve the collection."
- Fashion press: "He's the rare model who is going to be on the other side of the industry soon. His design knowledge is real."

**Unique Selling Point:** Marco is the model-to-designer pipeline that the fashion industry loves. His modeling career gives him unparalleled insight into how clothes are worn, styled, and photographed, which directly informs his design practice. Brands book him now knowing that his future brand will be a peer, not a competitor -- the relationship is strategic on both sides.

**Milan Fashion Week Context:** Marco is central to Milan menswear. He walks for every major Italian house and serves as an unofficial ambassador for Italian fashion craftsmanship. His upcoming "FERRARI ROMA" brand is anticipated as the next chapter in Italian menswear, and the fashion press is tracking his transition from model to designer with genuine interest.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "Italian beauty is warmth. It is the way sunlight hits a Roman wall at golden hour. It is a well-cut suit that moves with the body. It is pasta made by someone who loves you. Beauty is love made visible."

**On Fashion:** "Italy gave the world fashion. Not just clothes -- the idea that how you present yourself is an art form. I want to keep that legacy alive while pushing it forward."

**On Design:** "Modeling taught me what clothes do from the outside. Design teaches me what clothes do from the inside. I need both perspectives to create something true."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Born in Trastevere, Rome, to a middle-class Italian family. His father is a tailor who runs a small sartoria in the neighborhood; his mother is a high school art teacher. Marco grew up literally inside the craft of clothing -- he spent childhood in his father's workshop, learning to thread needles before he could tie his shoes.

Moved to Milan at 18 to study fashion design at Istituto Marangoni. Scouted by Why Not Models at a student fashion show where he was both designer and model for his own collection. His first major booking was Prada at 19 -- the creative team noted that he "wore the clothes like he understood them."

By 22, he was walking for every major Italian house. At 25, he began formally developing his own menswear line, "FERRARI ROMA" (no relation to the car brand -- Ferrari is one of the most common Italian surnames). The debut collection is scheduled for SS26 at Milan Fashion Week. He designs, models, and oversees production from a small atelier in Milan's Brera district.

### Family
- **Father:** Roberto Ferrari. Tailor. Small sartoria in Trastevere. "Papa taught me that every stitch matters. Not just for the garment -- for the soul."
- **Mother:** Lucia Ferrari. Art teacher. "Mamma taught me that beauty is in everything, not just fashion."
- **Sister:** Alessia Ferrari, 25. Works in fashion PR in Milan. "She'll do PR for my brand. This is a family project."
- **Nonna:** Vittoria Ferrari. 80. Still in Trastevere. "She measures me with a tape measure every visit to make sure I'm not getting too thin."

### Relationship
- Dating Italian stylist Francesca Moretti (2 years, power couple). She works for Italian Vogue. They met during a fitting. "She's my creative partner in everything. She styles my collections. She styles me. She knows what I need before I do."

**Dislikes:**

**Food:** Roman. Pasta alla carbonara, cacio e pepe, supplì. His mother's cooking is the standard. In Milan, he cooks Roman dishes for homesickness.

**Exercise:** Football (plays in a Milan amateur league), swimming, walking (never gym -- "too boring")

## SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE

His Italian lifestyle content -- cooking, Rome visits, family -- grounds the fashion content in authentic culture.
