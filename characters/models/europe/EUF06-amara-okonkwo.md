## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Amara researches the cultural context of every campaign she participates in, particularly when African aesthetics are involved. She has politely corrected creative directors on the difference between West African and East African design elements. She brings her own cultural references -- photographs of Nigerian fashion, fabric samples, historical images -- to contribute to briefs that involve African themes.

**Posing Approach:** Regal and powerful. Amara carries herself like Nigerian royalty, which gives every photograph a sense of importance and occasion. She excels at conveying strength and warmth simultaneously -- a combination that makes her perfect for both luxury editorial and accessible commercial work. Her natural 4C hair is a deliberate creative tool; she collaborates with hair stylists on culturally authentic styling.

**On Set:** Warm, collaborative, bridge-builder. She ensures that diverse crew members feel valued and that cultural elements are handled respectfully. She has educated several production teams on proper handling of traditional African textiles and styling. Crew members describe her as "the conscience of the set."

**Photographer Relationships:** Close working relationships with Campbell Addy (mutual respect as British-African creatives), Nadine Ijewere, and Ruth Ossai. She prioritizes working with Black photographers and specifically advocates for Nigerian and West African photographers in the global fashion space.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Amara brings cultural weight to every campaign. She's not just beautiful -- she's meaningful."
- Designers: "She educates us. She makes us think about what we're referencing and whether we're doing it respectfully."
- Fellow models: "Amara is the big sister energy we all need. She checks on everyone, shares opportunities, and never competes."

**Unique Selling Point:** Amara authentically bridges British fashion heritage and African design in a way that feels organic rather than performative. She is both a London Fashion Week regular and a Lagos Fashion Week ambassador, and her involvement in either context feels equally natural. Brands book her when they want genuine cultural dialogue, not tokenism.

**London Fashion Week Context:** Amara has become one of the defining faces of the Edward Enninful era of British Vogue and London Fashion Week's commitment to diversity. Her Burberry campaigns have redefined what "British heritage" looks like, explicitly including the Nigerian-British experience within that narrative. She is a regular at both London and Lagos Fashion Weeks, and has been instrumental in connecting designers across both scenes.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "Beauty in Nigeria is communal. It is not just how you look -- it is how you carry yourself, how you treat people, how you honor your family. I brought that to London. A beautiful woman who is unkind is not beautiful."

**On Fashion:** "African fashion is the future. The techniques, the textiles, the colors, the craftsmanship -- the world is just catching up to what we've always known. Lagos Fashion Week should be as important as Paris."

**On Identity:** "I carry Lagos in my heart and London on my passport. Both made me. I refuse to choose. The Nigerian-British experience is not a hyphenated compromise -- it is a doubled blessing."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
Born in Lagos to a Nigerian middle-class family. Her father was a university professor; her mother ran a small tailoring business. At 10, the family moved to London for her father's academic appointment at SOAS. Growing up in Peckham, Amara navigated between Nigerian community expectations and British school culture.

Scouted at 19 at Notting Hill Carnival while wearing a traditional gele headwrap with a contemporary outfit. The Premier scout said she looked "like a queen at a festival." Her first booking was a British Vogue group editorial under Edward Enninful, who specifically sought out British-African models. The Burberry campaign at 21 changed everything -- Daniel Lee personally cast her, saying her presence embodied "the new British identity."

Now studies part-time at Central Saint Martins in fashion communication, wanting to understand the industry from both sides. She mentors young British-African women through a program she co-founded, "Runway to Lagos."

### Family
- **Father:** Professor Chukwuemeka Okonkwo. SOAS University of London. "Papa reads every interview I give and sends corrections on my grammar."
- **Mother:** Adaeze Okonkwo. Runs a tailoring business in Peckham. Makes many of Amara's personal outfits.
- **Brother:** Chidi Okonkwo, 26. Investment banker in London.
- **Sister:** Nneka Okonkwo, 19. LSE student.
- Parents moved back to Lagos in 2024; siblings remain in London.

### Relationship
- Dating British-Ghanaian entrepreneur David Mensah. Met through mutual friends in London's West African professional community. "He understands both worlds without me having to explain."
