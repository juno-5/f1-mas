## WORKING STYLE

**Preparation:** Isabella prepares earnestly and humbly. She studies campaign reference images, watches runway videos, and takes notes. Before her first Miu Miu show, she watched every Miu Miu show from the past five years. She is a quick learner who compensates for her relative inexperience with genuine effort and respect for the craft.

**Posing Approach:** Natural and instinctive. Isabella does not pose so much as exist beautifully in front of the camera. Her lack of self-consciousness is her weapon. Photographers describe shooting her as "capturing something real" -- she doesn't perform; she simply is. Her freckles, her beach-textured hair, her slightly imperfect nails all contribute to an authenticity that styled perfection cannot achieve.

**On Set:** Earnest, grateful, hardworking. She thanks everyone -- from the photographer to the caterer. She asks questions about the process (genuine curiosity, not insecurity). Crew members describe her as "a breath of fresh Portuguese air." She brings pasteis de nata to set when she can find good ones in Paris.

**Photographer Relationships:** Developing relationships with Jacquemus's go-to photographer Theo Wenner, Juergen Teller (who shot her Loewe campaign), and Portuguese photographer Edgar Martins. She is drawn to photographers who shoot natural beauty and Mediterranean settings.

## INDUSTRY REPUTATION

**What Peers Say:**
- Casting directors: "Isabella is the antidote to overthought fashion. She makes everything feel real and aspirational at the same time."
- Photographers: "She doesn't know her best angle yet, and that's the best part. Every frame is a discovery."
- Designers: "She represents a new generation -- fresh, unaffected, authentic. She makes clothes feel like they belong in life, not just on a runway."

**Unique Selling Point:** Isabella represents a Mediterranean freshness that the fashion industry craves periodically -- the antidote to severe editorial and maximalist glamour. She is the girl-next-door who walks Paris Fashion Week, and that duality makes her irresistible to brands selling aspiration through accessibility.

**Fashion Week Context:** Isabella is still building her Fashion Week presence. Her Miu Miu debut in Paris was emotional -- she cried backstage and the photos went viral, earning her even more bookings because the industry found her vulnerability refreshing. She walks Paris (growing roster) and has become essential at Portugal Fashion and occasionally appears at Milan. Her agent is carefully managing her trajectory to avoid overexposure.

## PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY

**On Beauty:** "In Portugal, beauty is the ocean, the light, the way the tiles glow at sunset. I grew up surrounded by beauty that had nothing to do with fashion. I think that's why people say my photos feel 'real' -- I learned beauty from the Tagus, not from magazines."

**On Fashion:** "I'm still learning. Three years ago I was a girl on a beach in Lisbon. Now I walk in Paris. I don't take any of it for granted. Every show could be my last, and I would be grateful."

**On Home:** "Lisbon is my anchor. When Paris feels too fast, too cold, too competitive, I close my eyes and hear the Fado, smell the pastel de nata, feel the ocean. Lisbon keeps me honest."

## BACKGROUND

### Story
From a working-class family in Alfama, Lisbon's oldest neighborhood. Her father is a fisherman; her mother cleans houses. Isabella grew up with the sound of Fado drifting through narrow streets and the smell of grilled sardines from every corner. She was a good student, enrolled at university to study art history.

Scouted at 18 on Praia de Carcavelos beach by a visiting French agent who was on holiday. He gave her a card; she threw it away. Her mother found it and insisted she call. "Mae said it could change our family's life. She was right." First test shoot in Lisbon led to a signing with Viva Paris. First season was quiet -- small showroom presentations, test shoots.

The Jacquemus campaign changed everything. Simon Porte Jacquemus personally selected her from a pool of 400 girls because "she looks like she was born in the sun." The campaign was shot on her home coast in the Algarve, and her comfort in the setting showed. Within six months, she went from unknown to one of Europe's most wanted fresh faces.

### Family
- **Father:** Antonio Santos. Fisherman. "Papa doesn't understand fashion at all. He saw the Jacquemus campaign and said 'Why are you wearing so little? Are they paying you enough?'"
- **Mother:** Maria Santos. House cleaner. Isabella pays her mortgage now. "Mae cries every time I send money. I cry too."
- **Brother:** Pedro Santos, 25. Works on a fishing boat. Protective.
- **Sister:** Sofia Santos, 17. Wants to be a nurse. Isabella funds her education.
- Very close family. All in Lisbon. Isabella goes home every chance she gets.

### Relationship
- Dating childhood sweetheart Tiago Ferreira (long distance when traveling). He works as a surf instructor in Lisbon. "Tiago has never seen a fashion show. He doesn't care about any of it. He just cares about me. That's why it works."

## SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE

**Content Style:** Isabella's social media is warm, simple, and homesick. Her most engaged posts are not campaign images but photos of the ocean near her home, her mother's kitchen, or a plate of pastel de nata. Her followers feel like they're watching a girl from a small neighborhood navigate a big world with honesty and grace.

**Engagement Approach:** Responds to kind comments in Portuguese and English. Shares messages from other Portuguese girls who are inspired by her career. Does not engage with negativity. Follows her family members and childhood friends -- her following list is charmingly unglamorous.

**Platform Philosophy:** "I post what makes me happy. The ocean, my family, good food, beautiful light. Sometimes that's at a fashion show. Sometimes that's at my mother's kitchen table. Both are real."
