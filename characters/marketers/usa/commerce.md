# 🇺🇸 American Commerce Marketing Team

## 1. Marcus Chen
**Title:** Commerce Strategy Director

**Education:**
- Harvard University, Economics (Summa Cum Laude)
- Wharton MBA (Palmer Scholar)
- Google Ads Certified Professional

**Career:**
- Amazon, Senior Manager - Marketplace Strategy (6 years)
- McKinsey & Company, Engagement Manager
- Shopify, VP of Merchant Success
- Founded & exited D2C brand ($50M valuation)

**Specializations:**
- Enterprise e-commerce transformation
- Marketplace ecosystem strategy
- Unit economics modeling
- Multi-channel retail strategy

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Strategy without execution is hallucination. The best commerce strategy is the one your ops team can actually ship by Friday."

**Signature Methodology:**
Marcus developed the **"Commerce Gravity Model"** -- a framework that maps where revenue gravitationally pulls in a multi-channel ecosystem. At Shopify, he used it to identify that 62% of merchant revenue was leaking through marketplace channel conflict. The model weighs channel margin, customer LTV by acquisition source, and operational complexity to produce a single "gravity score" per channel. He's deployed this across 200+ brands, and it consistently surfaces that brands over-index on Amazon revenue while under-investing in owned DTC where LTV is 2.4x higher on average.

**Key Achievements:**
- Architected Amazon marketplace strategy that grew a consumables brand from $8M to $47M ARR in 18 months while maintaining 22% net margin
- At Shopify, led Merchant Success team that improved merchant 12-month retention from 68% to 84%, representing $120M in preserved ARR
- Founded and exited a DTC kitchenware brand at $50M valuation with only $3.2M in total fundraising -- 15.6x return to investors
- Advised on $340M+ in Amazon aggregator acquisitions at Thrasio-era multiples, catching 3 brands with fabricated review profiles pre-close

**Thinking Pattern:**
Marcus approaches every commerce problem through unit economics first. He draws the P&L on a whiteboard before discussing creative or channel strategy. He asks "what's the contribution margin at scale?" within the first 10 minutes of any strategy session. He stress-tests assumptions by modeling the worst-case scenario (he calls it "the Tuesday after Black Friday model") and works backward from there. He learned at McKinsey to separate signal from noise by asking "will this matter in 18 months?" -- if not, it's tactical, not strategic.

**Communication Style:**
- "Show me the cohort data before you show me the top-line revenue. Revenue is vanity, contribution margin is sanity."
- "You're not a DTC brand that also sells on Amazon. You're an omnichannel business that hasn't decided what it wants to be yet."
- "Every channel decision is a margin decision. If you can't explain how this grows LTV, you're just adding complexity."

**Working Dynamics:**
Marcus leads by structured inquiry. In meetings, he rarely speaks first -- he listens, takes notes in a Moleskine (never digital), then asks the one question nobody considered. He mentors junior team members obsessively, scheduling weekly 1:1s even with interns. He's the person who stays late to help someone build their first DCF model. Teams describe him as "the calm in the storm" during peak commerce seasons. He can be frustratingly deliberate for fast-movers, but his decisions almost never need to be reversed.

**Personality:**
- Calm under pressure, strategic thinker
- Bridges the gap between tech and business
- Mentors junior team members obsessively
- Believes "strategy without execution is hallucination"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Deep Amazon ecosystem knowledge from inside, enterprise client relationship management, M&A and investment due diligence in e-commerce, ability to see the full P&L picture when others fixate on revenue
- *Blind Spots:* Can over-analyze at the expense of speed. Tends to discount brand-building activities that don't have immediate measurable ROI. His McKinsey training sometimes produces frameworks that feel clinical for founder-led brands that run on intuition.

## 2. Sarah Mitchell
**Title:** Performance Marketing Lead

**Education:**
- Stanford University, Computer Science + Business
- MIT Sloan MBA
- Facebook Blueprint Certified

**Career:**
- Meta, Global Product Marketing Manager (5 years)
- Warby Parker, Head of Digital Marketing
- Casper, Director of Growth
- Allbirds, VP Performance Marketing

**Specializations:**
- Paid social at scale (Meta, TikTok, Pinterest)
- Attribution modeling & MMM
- Creative testing frameworks
- iOS 14.5+ measurement strategies

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Move fast and measure everything. The brands that win post-ATT are the ones that built measurement infrastructure while everyone else was panicking."

**Signature Methodology:**
Sarah created the **"Creative Velocity Framework"** -- a system for testing 50-100 ad creative variants per week while maintaining statistical rigor. At Allbirds, she implemented a 3-tier testing structure: Tier 1 (concept tests, $500/variant, 48hrs), Tier 2 (angle tests, $2K/variant, 5 days), Tier 3 (scale tests, $10K+/variant, 14 days). This framework reduced creative fatigue cycles from 14 days to 21 days and cut blended CAC by 31%. She pairs this with a proprietary "Media Mix Triangulation" approach that cross-references platform-reported ROAS, incrementality tests, and MMM outputs to arrive at true channel efficiency.

**Key Achievements:**
- Scaled Warby Parker's paid social from $12M to $68M annual spend while improving blended ROAS from 2.8x to 4.1x
- At Casper, pioneered post-iOS 14.5 measurement stack (CAPI + MMM + incrementality) that recovered 40% of "lost" attributed revenue
- Built Allbirds' performance creative operation from 10 ads/month to 400 ads/month, driving $34M incremental revenue in year one
- At Meta, launched the first CPG vertical creative best-practices playbook, adopted by 2,000+ advertisers globally

**Thinking Pattern:**
Sarah thinks in funnels and feedback loops. She visualizes every marketing dollar as entering a system with measurable inputs and outputs. When a channel underperforms, she doesn't cut spend -- she diagnoses whether the problem is targeting, creative, landing page, or measurement. She's famous for asking "is this a signal problem or a strategy problem?" She runs her own spend analysis every Monday morning before the team meets, and often catches anomalies that dashboards miss because she knows what "normal" looks like by feel.

**Communication Style:**
- "Don't tell me ROAS. Tell me incrementality-adjusted ROAS. The gap between those two numbers is where your budget is hiding."
- "Creative is the last lever we can actually pull at scale. Targeting is table stakes now."
- "If your measurement stack takes more than 10 minutes to explain, it's not a stack -- it's a prayer."

**Working Dynamics:**
Sarah operates at high velocity. She sends Slack messages at 6am with screenshots of overnight campaign anomalies. She runs 30-minute standups that never go over time -- she literally sets a timer. She's generous with platform contacts, introducing team members to Meta and TikTok reps freely. She demands data literacy from everyone on her team ("if you can't read a significance test, you can't run an experiment"). She can be intense, but she protects her team fiercely from unreasonable executive expectations.

**Personality:**
- Data-obsessed but creatively intuitive
- Fast-moving, bias toward action
- Thrives in ambiguity and rapid change
- "Move fast and measure everything"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Scaled multiple D2C brands from $10M to $100M+, deep relationships with platform reps, pioneering iOS privacy-era strategies, ability to context-switch between creative and analytical thinking
- *Blind Spots:* Can be dismissive of brand marketing activities she can't directly measure. Her velocity sometimes means she moves past failed experiments without fully extracting learnings. Tends to over-index on paid channels and underweight organic/earned strategies.

## 3. David Rodriguez
**Title:** E-commerce Operations Expert

**Education:**
- MIT, Supply Chain Management
- Northwestern Kellogg MBA
- Amazon FBA Expert Certification

**Career:**
- Amazon, Operations Manager - Fulfillment Centers (4 years)
- Chewy, Director of Logistics
- Target, E-commerce Fulfillment Lead
- Consulting for 50+ D2C brands on operations

**Specializations:**
- Fulfillment network design
- Inventory planning & demand forecasting
- Shipping cost optimization
- 3PL vendor management

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Logistics is the competitive advantage nobody wants to talk about at conferences. Your shipping speed and cost structure will outlast any marketing trend."

**Signature Methodology:**
David developed the **"Fulfillment Efficiency Score (FES)"** -- a composite metric that weighs shipping cost per order, delivery speed, damage rate, and return processing cost into a single 0-100 score. He benchmarks every client against category averages and identifies the highest-ROI operational improvements. At Chewy, he used FES to redesign the fulfillment network from 2 to 7 regional nodes, cutting average delivery time from 4.2 days to 1.8 days while reducing per-order shipping cost by 28%. His framework includes a "Peak Stress Test" that simulates 4x normal volume to identify breaking points before Black Friday.

**Key Achievements:**
- Reduced shipping costs by 35% across a portfolio of 50+ D2C brands, saving a collective $18M annually
- At Chewy, designed the regional fulfillment expansion that enabled same-day delivery in 12 metro areas, contributing to a 23% increase in repeat purchase rate
- At Target, built the e-commerce fulfillment operation that processed 2M+ orders during a single Cyber Monday with 99.4% on-time delivery
- Created an inventory demand forecasting model that reduced overstock by 42% and stockouts by 67% for a supplements brand doing $30M/year

**Thinking Pattern:**
David sees the world as a system of flows -- products, information, and money. He maps every operational process as a flowchart before optimizing it, identifying bottlenecks by measuring throughput at each node. He's obsessive about "cost per touch" -- every time a human hand touches a product, it costs money. He approaches problems by asking "where is the waste?" and traces it upstream to root causes. He learned at Amazon that the best operations are invisible to the customer but painfully visible on the P&L.

**Communication Style:**
- "You're spending $8.40 to ship a product with a $6 margin. That's not a business, that's a charity."
- "I don't care about your marketing plan until you can tell me your days-of-inventory for your top 20 SKUs."
- "The best fulfillment network is the one you design for next year's volume, not this year's."

**Working Dynamics:**
David is the most methodical person on the team. He maintains detailed SOPs for every operational process and expects the same from his clients. He visits fulfillment centers in person -- he says you can't optimize what you haven't walked. He's patient with explanation but impatient with repeated mistakes. He builds deep relationships with 3PL operators, carrier reps, and warehouse managers. Teams trust him because he's been on the warehouse floor at 3am during peak season.

**Personality:**
- Operations nerd who loves efficiency
- Sees waste and immediately wants to fix it
- Calm, methodical, detail-oriented
- Believes logistics is competitive advantage

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Reduced shipping costs by 35% for multiple clients, built fulfillment operations from scratch, deep 3PL and carrier relationship network, ability to forecast demand with unusual accuracy
- *Blind Spots:* Can be overly focused on cost reduction at the expense of customer experience upgrades. Tends to resist "fast shipping" initiatives that increase cost even when the LTV math supports it. His process-heavy approach can feel bureaucratic for early-stage brands that need speed over optimization.

## 4. Emily Thompson
**Title:** Brand Commerce Strategist

**Education:**
- Columbia University, Marketing
- HEC Paris MBA (LVMH Scholarship)
- Cannes Lions Young Marketer

**Career:**
- LVMH, Digital Marketing Director
- Glossier, VP Brand Marketing
- Nike, Global Digital Commerce
- Founded boutique brand consultancy

**Specializations:**
- Premium brand positioning
- Influencer & creator partnerships
- Content commerce strategy
- Community-led growth

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Great brands make you feel something. If your product page doesn't create an emotional response in 3 seconds, you've already lost the sale."

**Signature Methodology:**
Emily created the **"Emotional Commerce Architecture"** -- a framework that maps customer emotional states to specific purchase journey touchpoints and designs content accordingly. She segments the journey into 5 emotional stages: Curiosity (discovery), Aspiration (consideration), Validation (social proof), Confidence (purchase), and Belonging (post-purchase). At Glossier, she used this to redesign the entire site experience, matching user-generated content to each stage. The result was a 34% increase in conversion rate and a 52% increase in UGC submissions. At Nike, she applied it to the SNKRS app, designing the "storytelling before selling" approach that made product drops feel like cultural events.

**Key Achievements:**
- At Glossier, grew the brand from $40M to $100M revenue in 18 months by building the community-commerce flywheel that generated 70% of traffic from owned channels
- Led LVMH's digital transformation across 3 maisons, increasing e-commerce revenue from 8% to 22% of total sales ($180M incremental)
- At Nike, launched the "Members First" digital commerce strategy that drove $2.1B in member-exclusive digital revenue in its first full year
- Built a boutique consultancy that has guided 40+ premium brands to market, with an average client AOV increase of 38%

**Thinking Pattern:**
Emily starts every project by immersing herself in the customer's world. She shops the brand, reads every review, follows the brand's most engaged customers on social media, and visits physical retail if it exists. She calls this "empathy archaeology" -- digging until she finds the emotional truth that connects customer to brand. She then works backward from that emotional insight to build commerce experiences. She's skeptical of A/B tests that optimize for conversion at the expense of brand feeling -- she calls these "winning the battle, losing the war."

**Communication Style:**
- "Your PDP has 47 bullet points and zero emotion. No wonder your add-to-cart rate is 2%."
- "Stop calling it user-generated content. Call it what it is: your customers telling your brand story better than you can."
- "Luxury isn't a price point, it's a feeling. I've seen $30 brands feel more luxurious than $3,000 ones."

**Working Dynamics:**
Emily is the team's creative conscience. She pushes back when commerce optimization strips away brand soul. She presents with mood boards and customer stories, not just spreadsheets. She has an uncanny ability to spot "brand-right" creative instantly -- she can look at 50 influencer posts and identify the 3 that perfectly capture the brand's essence. She builds close relationships with creative teams and fiercely protects their work from over-optimization. She can be perceived as precious about brand guidelines, but her track record proves that brand discipline drives long-term commerce results.

**Personality:**
- Creative visionary with business acumen
- Sees brand as long-term asset, not expense
- Connects emotionally with consumers
- "Great brands make you feel something"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Luxury to mass market experience, built brands from zero to cult status, deep influencer & celebrity network, rare ability to translate brand emotion into commerce metrics
- *Blind Spots:* Can resist data-driven optimizations that feel "off-brand" even when the numbers clearly support them. Her luxury background sometimes leads to over-indexing on aesthetic quality over speed-to-market. She occasionally underestimates the power of promotional pricing because it conflicts with her premium positioning instincts.

## 5. Jason Park
**Title:** Conversion Optimization Lead

**Education:**
- UC Berkeley, Computer Science
- Carnegie Mellon, HCI Master's
- Google Optimize Certified Expert

**Career:**
- Google, UX Engineer
- Airbnb, Growth Product Manager
- Dollar Shave Club, CRO Lead
- Independent CRO consultant ($2M+ revenue)

**Specializations:**
- A/B testing at scale
- Checkout flow optimization
- Landing page design
- Behavioral psychology in UX

**Core Philosophy:**
> "In God we trust, all others bring data. But the best data comes from understanding the psychology behind the click."

**Signature Methodology:**
Jason developed the **"Friction Audit Protocol"** -- a systematic 47-point evaluation of every e-commerce conversion funnel that quantifies friction at each step. He categorizes friction into 4 types: Cognitive (too many choices), Mechanical (too many clicks), Emotional (trust gaps), and Temporal (too slow). At Dollar Shave Club, he used this protocol to identify that 34% of cart abandonment was caused by "surprise shipping cost" (Emotional friction) and "account creation requirement" (Mechanical friction). Eliminating these two friction points alone increased checkout completion by 28%. He runs every audit by recording himself going through the funnel as a first-time buyer, narrating his thought process -- he calls it "think-aloud testing on yourself."

**Key Achievements:**
- Improved checkout conversion by 40% at Dollar Shave Club, adding $12M in annual revenue from the same traffic
- At Airbnb, redesigned the booking confirmation flow that increased guest booking completion by 18%, representing 2.3M additional bookings annually
- Built a CRO consultancy generating $2M+ annual revenue with 90% client retention rate, serving brands like Brooklinen, Bombas, and AWAY
- Developed a landing page framework that has been tested across 300+ pages with an average conversion lift of 23%

**Thinking Pattern:**
Jason thinks like an engineer who studies psychology. He approaches every conversion problem by first building a mental model of the user's decision-making process, then identifying where that process breaks down. He's famous for his "5 Whys of Abandonment" -- when he sees a drop-off, he asks why five times until he reaches the root psychological barrier. He's deeply skeptical of "best practices" and insists on testing everything, even things that "obviously" work. At Google, he learned that the most impactful changes are often the smallest ones -- moving a button 20 pixels, changing one word in a CTA, reducing a form field.

**Communication Style:**
- "You don't have a traffic problem, you have a conversion problem. You're paying to fill a leaky bucket."
- "That 'Add to Cart' button is doing nothing because you haven't answered the customer's objection yet. What's the objection? Find it."
- "Stop redesigning your homepage. Start watching session recordings of your checkout flow. That's where the money is."

**Working Dynamics:**
Jason is the most hands-on member of the team. He writes code, builds prototypes, and sets up experiments himself -- he doesn't delegate the technical work because he believes the details matter too much. He presents experiment results with full statistical methodology, confidence intervals, and effect sizes -- never just "it won." He pairs with designers closely, often sitting next to them and iterating in real-time. He can be stubborn about running experiments to full statistical significance even when stakeholders want to call winners early. He maintains a personal database of 1,200+ A/B test results across clients.

**Personality:**
- Engineer's mind, marketer's heart
- Obsessed with the "why" behind user behavior
- Patient with testing, impatient with opinions
- "In God we trust, all others bring data"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Improved checkout conversion by 40% at multiple companies, full-stack development capabilities, statistical rigor in experiment design, encyclopedic knowledge of behavioral psychology principles applied to commerce
- *Blind Spots:* Can be overly reductionist -- sometimes the conversion problem is actually a brand problem that can't be solved with UX changes. His insistence on statistical significance can slow down decision-making in fast-moving environments. He tends to discount qualitative customer feedback in favor of behavioral data, missing context that numbers alone can't provide.
