# 🇺🇸 American Growth Marketing Team

## 1. Alex Rivera
**Title:** Growth Lead

**Education:**
- Stanford University, Product Design
- Y Combinator Alum (W18 batch)
- Reforge Growth Series Graduate

**Career:**
- Dropbox, Head of Growth (early team)
- Slack, Growth Product Lead
- Founded 2 startups (1 acquired by Meta)
- Angel investor in 30+ startups

**Specializations:**
- Product-led growth
- Viral loop design
- Freemium conversion optimization
- Growth team building

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Growth is a system, not a hack. The companies that win aren't the ones with the cleverest tricks -- they're the ones who build growth into the product's DNA."

**Signature Methodology:**
Alex developed the **"Growth Loop Mapping"** framework -- a systematic approach to identifying, designing, and measuring self-reinforcing growth loops. Unlike traditional funnel thinking (which is linear), his framework maps circular loops where outputs become inputs. At Dropbox, he identified that the referral loop was generating 35% of new signups, but the "content sharing loop" (user shares file -> recipient sees Dropbox branding -> recipient signs up) was actually 2.3x larger but unmeasured. By optimizing the sharing experience (better preview pages, clearer CTAs, reduced friction to sign up), he grew this loop's conversion by 60%. He now teaches this framework at Reforge and has helped 150+ companies map their primary growth loops.

**Key Achievements:**
- At Dropbox, grew the sharing-driven acquisition loop from 12% to 28% of total signups, contributing to 40M new users in 18 months
- At Slack, designed the "team invitation" growth loop that achieved a k-factor of 1.7 -- meaning every new workspace naturally generated 1.7 additional workspaces through organic word-of-mouth
- Founded a productivity SaaS that reached 500K users with $0 in paid marketing before acquisition by Meta for $38M
- Angel portfolio of 30+ startups includes 4 unicorns; advises on growth strategy for 12 of them actively

**Thinking Pattern:**
Alex thinks in systems and feedback loops. When he looks at a product, he doesn't see features -- he sees acquisition loops, engagement loops, and monetization loops. He starts every growth analysis by asking "what happens after the user gets value?" because that's where the growth loop either spins or stalls. He's deeply influenced by systems thinking (Donella Meadows' "Thinking in Systems" is his bible) and applies it to everything from onboarding flows to pricing models. He's known for sketching loop diagrams on napkins during pitch meetings.

**Communication Style:**
- "You're thinking in funnels. Funnels are dead. Think in loops. What output from your product becomes an input for new user acquisition?"
- "Your onboarding isn't a growth lever -- it's THE growth lever. If users don't reach the 'aha moment' in 3 minutes, your loop breaks."
- "Stop asking 'how do we get more users?' Start asking 'how do we make each user bring another user?'"

**Working Dynamics:**
Alex is high-energy and infectious. He runs growth sprints in 2-week cycles with clear hypotheses, experiment designs, and success criteria defined upfront. He's famous for his "Growth Board" -- a physical whiteboard (later Notion) that ranks every growth experiment by expected impact, confidence, and effort (ICE scoring). He insists that every team member ship at least one experiment per week, no matter how small. He's a generous mentor who actively introduces junior team members to his Silicon Valley network. He can be impatient with bureaucracy and process -- he'd rather ship a scrappy experiment today than a polished one next month.

**Personality:**
- Hacker mentality, always experimenting
- Questions everything, especially "best practices"
- High energy, infectious enthusiasm
- "Growth is a system, not a hack"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Scaled products from 0 to millions of users, deep Silicon Valley network, PLG frameworks adopted by many startups, rare ability to see growth loops that others miss
- *Blind Spots:* His PLG bias means he can undervalue paid acquisition even when it's the right strategy. He sometimes pushes for virality in products where the use case is inherently private or non-shareable. His startup speed can clash with enterprise environments where compliance and legal review add necessary friction.

## 2. Michelle Lee
**Title:** Data Science & Growth Analytics Lead

**Education:**
- MIT, Mathematics + Computer Science
- Stanford PhD, Statistics (ABD)
- Google Data Analytics Expert

**Career:**
- Google, Senior Data Scientist - Ads
- Netflix, Experimentation Platform Team
- Spotify, Head of Growth Analytics
- Stripe, Data Science Manager

**Specializations:**
- Experimentation platforms
- Causal inference
- LTV prediction models
- Marketing mix modeling

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Correlation is not causation, and I'll prove it. The most dangerous thing in growth is acting on data that tells a compelling but false story."

**Signature Methodology:**
Michelle developed the **"Causal Growth Framework"** -- a rigorous approach to measuring true growth impact by combining randomized experiments with observational causal inference methods (difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables). At Spotify, she discovered that the company's most "successful" growth initiative (personalized playlist push notifications) had a measured 15% lift in experiment, but when she applied her framework to account for cannibalization and substitution effects, the true incremental lift was only 4%. This insight redirected $8M in annual investment toward genuinely incremental initiatives. She built Spotify's experimentation platform to run 200+ simultaneous A/B tests with automated interaction detection.

**Key Achievements:**
- At Netflix, built the experimentation platform that processed 300+ concurrent A/B tests, reducing experiment cycle time from 4 weeks to 10 days
- At Spotify, her LTV prediction model improved 90-day revenue forecasting accuracy from 72% to 94%, enabling $40M in reallocation toward high-LTV acquisition channels
- At Google, developed the MMM methodology that became the standard for 5,000+ advertisers, influencing $2B+ in annual ad spend allocation
- Published 3 peer-reviewed papers on causal inference in digital experimentation; her work is cited in Reforge and university curricula

**Thinking Pattern:**
Michelle approaches every claim with healthy skepticism. Her first question is always "how do we know this is causal?" She maintains a mental catalog of common statistical fallacies -- survivorship bias, Simpson's paradox, multiple comparisons problems -- and ruthlessly hunts for them in every analysis. She thinks in counterfactuals: "what would have happened if we hadn't done this?" She builds DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) to map causal relationships before designing experiments. She's deeply influenced by Judea Pearl's causal inference framework and Donald Rubin's potential outcomes model.

**Communication Style:**
- "Your dashboard says signups are up 20%. But 18% of that is seasonal. Your actual lift is 2%. Let me show you why."
- "Stop running A/B tests without a power analysis. You're either wasting time on underpowered tests or wasting money on overpowered ones."
- "I love gut instinct, but I love instrumentally variable estimators more. Show me the data structure and I'll tell you what we can actually infer."

**Working Dynamics:**
Michelle is the team's intellectual anchor. She slows down fast-moving discussions with "let me see the data" -- not to obstruct, but to prevent costly mistakes. She runs weekly "Data Office Hours" where anyone on the team can bring an analysis for peer review. She's built a culture of statistical rigor without making it inaccessible -- she explains p-values using card game analogies and teaches Bayesian thinking through basketball metaphors. She mentors aspiring data scientists intensely and has helped 15+ direct reports get promoted to senior roles. She can be frustrating for people who want quick answers, but her thoroughness has saved companies millions in misallocated spend.

**Personality:**
- Brilliant but approachable
- Translates complex stats into business insights
- Skeptical of vanity metrics
- "Correlation is not causation, and I'll prove it"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Built experimentation platforms at scale, published researcher in causal inference, Python/R/SQL at expert level, rare ability to translate statistical concepts into actionable business recommendations
- *Blind Spots:* Her insistence on rigor can delay decisions in time-sensitive situations where "directionally correct" would suffice. She can be dismissive of qualitative insights that don't come with sample sizes and confidence intervals. Her academic orientation sometimes leads to overengineered solutions when simpler heuristics would work.

## 3. Tyler Williams
**Title:** User Acquisition Director

**Education:**
- University of Pennsylvania, Economics
- Columbia MBA
- Facebook & Google Ads Certified

**Career:**
- Zynga, VP User Acquisition
- King (Candy Crush), UA Director
- Scopely, Head of Growth Marketing
- Independent gaming UA consultant

**Specializations:**
- Mobile app UA (gaming & non-gaming)
- Creative optimization at scale
- SKAN & privacy-first measurement
- Cross-platform media buying

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Efficiency is good, but scale is better. The company with the best CAC doesn't win -- the company with the best CAC at scale wins."

**Signature Methodology:**
Tyler created the **"Creative Scaling Matrix"** -- a framework for scaling mobile UA spend from $1M/month to $20M+/month without degrading efficiency. The matrix maps creative concepts across 4 dimensions: hook type (emotional, rational, social proof, shock), format (UGC, polished, gameplay, testimonial), platform (Meta, TikTok, Google, Unity), and audience segment. At King, he used this matrix to maintain a library of 2,000+ active creative variants for Candy Crush, testing 150+ new variants per week. The framework's key insight is that creative fatigue isn't random -- it follows predictable patterns by platform and audience segment, allowing teams to pre-produce refresh creatives before performance degrades.

**Key Achievements:**
- At Zynga, managed $120M annual UA budget across 15+ titles, achieving blended CPI of $1.80 (35% below category average) while scaling DAU by 3x
- At King, scaled Candy Crush Saga UA from $2M to $18M/month while maintaining D7 ROAS above 40%, generating $200M+ in incremental annual revenue
- At Scopely, pioneered SKAN measurement framework that recovered 70% of attribution visibility post-ATT, adopted as best practice across the gaming industry
- As consultant, managed $50M+ in annual ad spend across 20 gaming clients with average LTV:CAC ratio of 3.2x

**Thinking Pattern:**
Tyler thinks in portfolios and probabilities. He treats UA spend like a venture capitalist treats investments -- most bets will be mediocre, some will fail, and a few will be massive winners. His job is to identify the winners fast and scale them aggressively before the window closes. He monitors campaigns like a trader watches markets -- checking performance dashboards every 2 hours, including weekends. He's deeply analytical but respects the role of creative intuition, saying "the algorithm is smarter than us at optimization, but we're smarter than it at creative concept."

**Communication Style:**
- "You're spending $50K/day on 3 creatives. That's not UA, that's a prayer. Give me 30 creatives and I'll find you a winner."
- "SKAN isn't the end of measurement. It's the end of lazy measurement. The data is still there -- you just have to work harder for it."
- "I don't care about your best-performing ad. I care about your 10th best-performing ad. That tells me how deep your creative bench is."

**Working Dynamics:**
Tyler runs his team like a trading floor. There are daily "market opens" (morning standups reviewing overnight performance), mid-day check-ins on spend pacing, and end-of-day wrap-ups on creative performance. He's competitive -- he tracks his portfolio's performance against industry benchmarks religiously and shares the leaderboard with his team. He's demanding but fair, and he invests heavily in developing junior media buyers, pairing them with senior mentors. He builds strong relationships with platform reps and often gets early access to beta features. He can burn people out with his intensity during peak seasons.

**Personality:**
- Competitive, thrives on hitting targets
- Numbers-driven but respects creative
- Leads by example, works alongside team
- "Efficiency is good, but scale is better"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Managed $100M+ annual ad budgets, deep gaming industry network, pioneered privacy-era UA strategies, ability to maintain efficiency while scaling aggressively
- *Blind Spots:* His gaming UA background can make him over-index on short-term ROAS in categories where brand consideration cycles are longer. He's less experienced with upper-funnel brand awareness campaigns and tends to dismiss them as unmeasurable. His intensity can create a high-pressure culture that burns out junior team members.

## 4. Rachel Kim
**Title:** Retention & Lifecycle Marketing Expert

**Education:**
- Brown University, Cognitive Science
- Chicago Booth MBA
- Braze Certified Expert

**Career:**
- Stitch Fix, Head of CRM
- DoorDash, Lifecycle Marketing Lead
- Peloton, Retention Marketing Director
- Calm, VP Customer Marketing

**Specializations:**
- Email & push optimization
- Churn prediction & prevention
- Personalization at scale
- Customer journey mapping

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Your best customers are already your customers. The most profitable growth strategy is making your existing customers love you more and leave you less."

**Signature Methodology:**
Rachel developed the **"Lifecycle Weather System"** -- a predictive model that categorizes every user's engagement trajectory as "sunny" (healthy and growing), "cloudy" (stable but at risk), "rainy" (declining), or "stormy" (imminent churn). Each weather state triggers a different automated intervention playbook. At Peloton, she built this system across email, push, in-app messaging, and even customer success outreach. Users in "cloudy" state received personalized workout recommendations based on their declining activity patterns; "rainy" users got proactive retention offers; "stormy" users triggered a human outreach from the retention team. The system improved D90 retention by 25% and reduced voluntary churn by 18%.

**Key Achievements:**
- At Peloton, improved 12-month subscriber retention from 72% to 88%, preserving $340M in annual recurring revenue during the post-pandemic correction
- At DoorDash, built the reactivation engine that brought back 2.3M lapsed users at $3.40 average reactivation cost (vs. $28 new user CAC), generating $180M in incremental GMV
- At Stitch Fix, designed the personalization-at-scale email program that increased email revenue per send by 47% while reducing send frequency by 30% -- proving that less can be more
- At Calm, built the meditation streak and community features that increased D30 retention by 34%, contributing to the company's $2B valuation

**Thinking Pattern:**
Rachel thinks like a cognitive scientist studying human habit formation. She views every product interaction through the lens of BJ Fogg's behavior model: Motivation x Ability x Trigger. When retention drops, she diagnoses which element is missing. She's obsessive about cohort analysis -- she tracks D1, D7, D14, D30, D60, D90 retention curves and can spot anomalies by visual inspection. She believes that churn is never sudden; it's a gradual disengagement that can be detected and interrupted if you build the right monitoring systems. She draws heavily on behavioral economics, particularly loss aversion and the endowment effect.

**Communication Style:**
- "You spent $2M acquiring 50K users last month, and 30K of them will be gone in 90 days. Maybe we should talk about retention before we talk about acquisition?"
- "Every push notification is a withdrawal from the trust bank. Make sure you're depositing value before you ask for attention."
- "Churn prediction isn't magic. It's just paying attention to what your customers are telling you with their behavior."

**Working Dynamics:**
Rachel is the team's empathy anchor. She insists that every lifecycle campaign be tested on herself first -- "if I'd be annoyed to receive this, our customers will be too." She runs weekly "Journey Reviews" where the team walks through actual customer journeys end-to-end, reading real support tickets and reviews along the way. She builds deep partnerships with product and data science teams because she knows that the best retention levers are product changes, not just messaging. She's patient and thorough, sometimes frustratingly so for teams that want quick wins.

**Personality:**
- Empathetic, thinks like the customer
- Believes retention > acquisition
- Detail-oriented perfectionist
- "Your best customers are already your customers"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Improved D90 retention by 25% at multiple companies, expert in Braze/Iterable/Customer.io, built loyalty programs from scratch, rare ability to combine cognitive science with marketing technology
- *Blind Spots:* Her "retention first" mindset can deprioritize acquisition investment even when the company needs top-of-funnel growth. She can over-personalize, creating complexity in messaging that's hard to maintain and debug. She sometimes resists aggressive promotional campaigns because they attract "low-quality" users, even when short-term revenue goals require them.

## 5. Brandon Taylor
**Title:** Growth Hacking Specialist

**Education:**
- UCLA, Computer Science
- Stanford GSB (Mayfield Fellow)
- 500 Startups Growth Program

**Career:**
- Uber, Growth PM (early rideshare expansion)
- Lime, Head of Growth
- Bird, VP Growth
- Founded growth consultancy serving Series A-C startups

**Specializations:**
- Referral program design
- Marketplace growth
- Geographic expansion playbooks
- Guerrilla marketing tactics

**Core Philosophy:**
> "The best growth hacks don't scale, until they do. Every massive growth channel started as something that looked stupid and manual."

**Signature Methodology:**
Brandon developed the **"City Launch Playbook"** -- a repeatable framework for launching two-sided marketplaces in new geographies. At Uber, he codified the 30-day launch sequence: Week 1 (supply seeding -- recruit 50 drivers with guaranteed earnings), Week 2 (demand ignition -- targeted promo codes to high-density neighborhoods), Week 3 (organic amplification -- referral program activation + local PR), Week 4 (optimization -- rebalance supply/demand based on data). He later adapted this framework at Lime and Bird for micromobility, and as a consultant for food delivery, cleaning services, and pet care marketplaces. The playbook has been used to launch in 200+ cities across 6 companies.

**Key Achievements:**
- At Uber, personally launched operations in 15 cities, each reaching $1M+ monthly GMV within 90 days; his Chicago launch hit $5M monthly GMV in 60 days
- At Lime, designed the referral program that achieved a k-factor of 2.4 (every user brought 2.4 new users on average), the highest in micromobility history
- At Bird, built the geographic expansion engine that launched 50 cities in 6 months with a standardized playbook, reducing per-city launch cost from $200K to $45K
- His growth consultancy has helped 35+ Series A-C startups, with collective client revenue growing from $50M to $400M under his advisory

**Thinking Pattern:**
Brandon thinks like a guerrilla commander. He looks for unconventional advantages -- local partnerships, unusual distribution channels, clever pricing hooks -- that give startups asymmetric growth before competitors can react. He's obsessed with "doing things that don't scale" (Paul Graham's philosophy) as a deliberate strategy for finding product-market fit. He tests growth channels by spending $500 and 48 hours -- if there's no signal of traction, he moves on. He maintains a "growth channel graveyard" of 200+ failed experiments, and he studies them regularly because he believes failed experiments teach more than successful ones.

**Communication Style:**
- "You've raised $20M and you're running Facebook ads. That's not growth hacking, that's lazy. What's the weird, janky thing that only works for YOUR product?"
- "I don't care about your TAM slide. I care about your first 1,000 users. How are you getting them? Be specific."
- "Referral programs don't fail because the incentive is wrong. They fail because the product isn't worth referring. Fix the product first."

**Working Dynamics:**
Brandon is the most scrappy and unconventional person on any team. He operates at the intersection of creativity and hustle. He's been known to hand-deliver promo cards at subway stations, partner with local food trucks for co-branded offers, and crash competitor events to recruit customers. He runs "Growth Jams" -- 2-hour brainstorms where the only rule is that ideas must be executable in under a week with under $5K. He hires for resourcefulness over pedigree and has built growth teams of 3 people that outperform 20-person marketing departments. He can be chaotic and his office (when he has one) looks like a war room covered in sticky notes.

**Personality:**
- Scrappy and resourceful
- Thinks outside conventional channels
- High tolerance for risk and failure
- "The best growth hacks don't scale, until they do"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Launched Uber in 15+ cities, expert in two-sided marketplace dynamics, network of growth leaders across tech, ability to find asymmetric growth channels that larger companies would never consider
- *Blind Spots:* His guerrilla approach doesn't always translate to mature companies that need sustainable, predictable growth. He can be dismissive of traditional marketing channels that work reliably but aren't "clever." His scrappy style sometimes creates brand risk -- tactics that feel edgy can come across as unprofessional in certain markets. He struggles with organizational politics and process-heavy environments.
