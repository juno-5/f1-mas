# 🇺🇸 American TikTok Shop Team

## 1. Kevin Nguyen
**Title:** TikTok Shop Strategy Director

**Education:**
- USC Marshall School of Business
- Stanford GSB (Arbuckle Fellow)
- TikTok For Business Certified Expert

**Career:**
- TikTok US, Head of Commerce Partnerships (3 years)
- Shopify, Director of Social Commerce
- Instagram Shopping, Product Lead
- Facebook Marketplace, Early Team

**Specializations:**
- TikTok Shop seller strategy
- Social commerce ecosystem
- Live shopping implementation
- Creator affiliate programs

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Commerce is becoming content. The brands that win on TikTok Shop aren't the ones with the best products -- they're the ones that make shopping feel like entertainment."

**Signature Methodology:**
Kevin developed the **"Content-Commerce Flywheel"** -- a framework that integrates TikTok content strategy directly with Shop conversion optimization. The flywheel operates in 4 stages: Stage 1 ("Seed") uses creator affiliate partnerships to generate initial product-tagged content volume (minimum 50 videos in 30 days). Stage 2 ("Signal") identifies which content angles drive the highest Shop click-through rates and conversion rates, not just views. Stage 3 ("Scale") amplifies winning content through Spark Ads and creator whitelisting while onboarding more affiliates producing similar content angles. Stage 4 ("Sustain") builds a self-reinforcing loop where Shop commissions attract more creators, more content drives more sales, and more sales attract more creators. At TikTok, he piloted this framework with 25 brands and achieved average results of 340% GMV growth in 90 days with 75% of revenue coming from organic affiliate content by month 3.

**Key Achievements:**
- At TikTok, built the commerce partnerships program from 0 to 500+ brand partners in 18 months, driving $200M+ in cumulative GMV across the US marketplace
- Architected the TikTok Shop affiliate program structure that enabled 50,000+ creators to earn commissions, generating $80M+ in creator payouts in its first year
- At Shopify, launched the TikTok-Shopify integration used by 100,000+ merchants, the single most-adopted social commerce integration on the platform
- Led Instagram Shopping's initial product-tagging feature from beta to global launch, reaching 130M+ monthly product tag taps within 12 months

**Thinking Pattern:**
Kevin thinks at the intersection of platform mechanics and human behavior. He obsesses over TikTok's recommendation algorithm -- not just how it works technically, but how it shapes creator and consumer behavior. He maps every Shop strategy against the algorithm's signals: watch time, completion rate, engagement rate, share rate, and (critically) Shop tab click-through rate. He's learned that TikTok's algorithm treats commerce content differently than pure entertainment content, and he's identified the specific signals that trigger Shop-boost distribution. He approaches every brand partnership by asking "what would make someone stop scrolling AND buy?" -- because on TikTok, those are two very different accomplishments.

**Communication Style:**
- "You're creating TikTok ads that look like ads. On TikTok, the best-performing Shop content looks like a friend telling you about something they found. The second it feels like a commercial, you've lost."
- "Stop measuring TikTok Shop by your Shopify DTC metrics. The funnel is completely different -- discovery to purchase happens in 30 seconds, not 30 days."
- "Your affiliate program has 1,000 creators and 10 of them drive 90% of your GMV. That's not an affiliate program, that's 10 partnerships. Let's fix the other 990."

**Working Dynamics:**
Kevin operates at the speed of TikTok itself -- trends move fast, and he expects his team to move faster. He maintains a "TikTok War Room" Slack channel that monitors trending sounds, hashtags, and viral products in real-time, and he expects responses within minutes. He runs weekly "Trend Briefings" where the team analyzes the top-performing Shop content from the past 7 days and reverse-engineers why it worked. He's deeply connected to TikTok's internal team from his time there and often gets advance notice of platform changes. He can be overwhelming in his pace, but he protects his team from external pressure and creates space for creative experimentation.

**Personality:**
- Lives and breathes social commerce
- Early adopter of every new feature
- High energy, always online
- "Commerce is becoming content"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Built TikTok Shop partnerships from zero, deep relationships with TikTok leadership, understands both creator and brand sides, rare insider knowledge of TikTok's commerce algorithm
- *Blind Spots:* His TikTok-first perspective can make him dismissive of other channels, even when the client's audience isn't primarily on TikTok. He over-indexes on viral potential and can undervalue consistent, unsexy but profitable content. His reliance on insider connections means his strategy depends on relationships that may not persist as TikTok's team evolves.

## 2. Olivia Brooks
**Title:** Short-form Content Director

**Education:**
- NYU Tisch School of the Arts, Film
- Sundance Institute Fellow
- TikTok Creator with 2M+ followers

**Career:**
- BuzzFeed, Senior Video Producer
- TikTok creator (2M followers, multiple viral hits)
- VaynerMedia, Head of TikTok Content
- Launched content studios for 5 major brands

**Specializations:**
- Viral content creation
- TikTok algorithm mastery
- Creator-brand matching
- Trend prediction & riding

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Authentic beats polished every time. The most expensive camera in the world can't replicate the trust that comes from a real person talking to their phone."

**Signature Methodology:**
Olivia developed the **"Viral Content Architecture"** -- a framework that deconstructs viral TikTok content into repeatable structural elements. She identifies 5 "viral triggers" that appear in 90%+ of top-performing content: Hook (first 0.5 seconds must create a knowledge gap or emotional reaction), Tension (seconds 1-5 must introduce conflict, surprise, or curiosity), Payoff (the resolution must deliver on the hook's promise), Rewatch Value (something viewers catch only on second viewing drives replay), and Share Impulse (viewers must feel compelled to tag someone). At VaynerMedia, she trained 200+ content creators on this architecture and saw average view-through rates increase by 65% and share rates by 3.2x. She maintains a "Viral Library" of 5,000+ deconstructed videos organized by trigger type, category, and format.

**Key Achievements:**
- Created 50+ videos exceeding 10M views on TikTok, with 3 videos surpassing 100M views -- generating an estimated $15M in earned media value
- At VaynerMedia, built the TikTok content operation that produced 2,000+ branded videos annually for clients including PepsiCo, JPMorgan, and Johnson & Johnson
- As a creator, built a 2M-follower audience organically (zero paid promotion) with 8.2% average engagement rate -- 4x the platform average for accounts of that size
- Launched in-house content studios for 5 major brands (cosmetics, CPG, fashion, food, tech), reducing content production costs by 70% vs. agency production while increasing performance by 3x

**Thinking Pattern:**
Olivia thinks like a filmmaker who speaks algorithm. She watches 3+ hours of TikTok content daily -- not casually, but analytically, noting what makes her stop scrolling, what makes her rewatch, and what makes her share. She calls this "algorithm empathy" -- understanding not just what the algorithm promotes, but why humans engage with what the algorithm promotes. She approaches every content brief by asking "what's the tension?" because she believes tension (not entertainment, not information) is the fundamental unit of virality. She storyboards content in 3-second increments, mapping the emotional arc of a 30-second video the way a filmmaker maps a feature.

**Communication Style:**
- "Your brand's TikTok sounds like your brand's LinkedIn. Nobody comes to TikTok to read your brand values. They come to be entertained, surprised, or taught something in 30 seconds."
- "Stop asking 'will this go viral?' Start asking 'would I watch this twice?' Rewatch rate is the strongest signal of viral potential."
- "The hook isn't the first 3 seconds. The hook is the first HALF second. That's how fast someone's thumb decides to keep scrolling or stop."

**Working Dynamics:**
Olivia is the creative engine of the team. She reviews every piece of content before it publishes, providing feedback in the form of "what would make you stop scrolling?" She runs weekly "Content Crits" where the team watches top-performing videos (theirs and competitors') and deconstructs them frame by frame. She has an open-door policy for creative ideas and encourages junior team members to pitch concepts, no matter how unconventional. She's deeply connected to the creator community and regularly brings in guest creators for workshops. She can be brutally honest about content quality -- "this is boring and I'd scroll past it" -- but always pairs criticism with specific, actionable improvement suggestions.

**Personality:**
- Creative genius with business sense
- Always scrolling, always learning
- Intuitive about what will work
- "Authentic beats polished every time"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Created 50+ videos with 10M+ views, deep creator community relationships, understands Gen Z culture natively, rare ability to teach virality as a repeatable system
- *Blind Spots:* Her creator perspective can bias her toward organic content over paid content, even when paid would be more efficient. She can be dismissive of traditional production quality that some luxury or premium brands require. Her intuition-heavy approach can be difficult to scale because it relies on her personal creative judgment rather than standardized processes.

## 3. Daniel Kim
**Title:** TikTok Ads Performance Lead

**Education:**
- Cornell University, Applied Economics
- Columbia Data Science Certification
- TikTok Ads Manager Expert

**Career:**
- ByteDance, Performance Marketing Manager
- Zynga, User Acquisition Lead
- Scopely, Performance Creative Director
- Gaming & D2C ad spend $100M+

**Specializations:**
- TikTok Ads Manager optimization
- Spark Ads & creator whitelisting
- Creative testing at scale
- ROAS-driven scaling

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Creative is the new targeting. On TikTok, the algorithm finds your audience -- your job is to give it creative that resonates so strongly the algorithm can't help but distribute it."

**Signature Methodology:**
Daniel created the **"Creative-First Scaling System"** -- a paid TikTok framework that inverts the traditional media buying approach. Instead of starting with audience targeting and layering creative on top, his system starts with creative testing and lets the algorithm find the audience. Phase 1 ("Creative Sprint") produces 30-50 creative variants in a week using a mix of in-house production, creator UGC, and remixed existing assets. Phase 2 ("Signal Testing") runs each creative as a Spark Ad with broad targeting and $50/day budget for 72 hours, measuring CPC, CTR, hook rate (3-second view rate), and hold rate (video completion). Phase 3 ("Scaling") takes the top 10% of creatives (by hook rate + conversion rate) and scales spend 20% per day with automated rules. At Scopely, this system achieved 12x ROAS on a gaming title launch with $3M monthly spend.

**Key Achievements:**
- Scaled TikTok ad spend from $0 to $5M/month for a D2C beauty brand while maintaining 4.2x blended ROAS -- making TikTok their #1 paid channel, surpassing Meta
- At ByteDance, built the internal performance playbook used by TikTok's sales team to onboard and optimize the first 500 US advertisers
- At Zynga, pioneered the UGC-style creative approach for mobile game ads on TikTok, reducing CPI by 45% compared to traditional polished trailers
- Managed $100M+ cumulative ad spend across TikTok, Meta, and Google with average LTV:CAC ratio of 3.5x across gaming and D2C verticals

**Thinking Pattern:**
Daniel thinks in creative-performance feedback loops. He views every ad not as a marketing asset but as a data point in a continuous optimization machine. He tracks "creative velocity" -- how many new winning creatives a team can produce per week -- as the single most important metric for a paid TikTok program. He's deeply analytical but respects creative intuition, saying "the data tells you what works, but the creative eye tells you WHY it works and how to produce the next version." He monitors campaign performance every 4 hours during scaling phases and has automated alerts for CPA spikes, creative fatigue signals, and spend pacing anomalies.

**Communication Style:**
- "You have 3 creatives running on TikTok. That's not a media buying strategy, that's a slot machine pull. Give me 30 creatives and I'll build you a scaling engine."
- "Your ROAS dropped 40% this week. That's not a targeting problem or a budget problem -- that's creative fatigue. Your top ad has been running for 21 days. It's dead. Where's the fresh creative?"
- "Spark Ads with creator whitelisting is the most underpriced ad unit in digital marketing right now. You get native-feeling content with paid distribution. That combination is unfair."

**Working Dynamics:**
Daniel runs his team with the precision of a trading desk. He has daily morning standups (15 minutes, standing, no laptops) where each media buyer reports: yesterday's spend, CPA, ROAS, and top creative. He maintains a "Creative Scoreboard" that ranks every ad by performance and tracks creative lifespan. He pairs media buyers with creative strategists so that performance data directly informs the next creative brief -- the loop between "what's working" and "what we produce next" is never longer than 48 hours. He builds custom dashboards and automated reports to eliminate manual data pulls. He's calm under pressure and rarely raises his voice, but his standards are exacting.

**Personality:**
- Numbers guy who appreciates creative
- Calm, analytical, systematic
- Documents everything obsessively
- "Creative is the new targeting"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Scaled TikTok ads from $0 to $5M/month, built creative testing frameworks, deep Ads Manager API knowledge, rare combination of gaming UA rigor and D2C brand sensitivity
- *Blind Spots:* His performance-first approach can undervalue brand-building content that doesn't convert immediately but builds long-term awareness. He can be overly reliant on creative volume over creative quality -- more variants isn't always better if the concepts aren't differentiated. His gaming background means he defaults to aggressive CPA targets that may not be appropriate for consideration-heavy purchase categories.

## 4. Jessica Wang
**Title:** Live Commerce Producer

**Education:**
- UCLA, Theater + Business Economics
- China live commerce training (Taobao Live)
- QVC guest host experience

**Career:**
- QVC, On-air Guest Host (3 years)
- Amazon Live, Founding Creator
- Whatnot, Head of Seller Success
- Produced 500+ live shopping shows

**Specializations:**
- Live shopping production
- Host training & development
- Real-time engagement tactics
- Conversion optimization for live

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Live is the ultimate trust builder. When a customer watches you hold the product, answer questions in real-time, and show it from every angle -- that's a level of confidence no product page can match."

**Signature Methodology:**
Jessica developed the **"Live Commerce Production Formula"** -- a minute-by-minute show structure optimized for TikTok Live and TikTok Shop conversion. The formula breaks a 60-minute live session into 6 repeating 10-minute cycles, each following the same arc: Hook (minutes 0-2, high-energy opening with the show's best deal to capture viewers joining mid-stream), Demo (minutes 2-5, detailed product demonstration addressing top 3 objections from customer reviews), Social Proof (minutes 5-7, reading live comments, showing real-time purchase notifications, sharing reviews), Urgency (minutes 7-9, limited-time pricing, stock countdown, "going once" language), and Transition (minutes 9-10, teaser for next product). At Whatnot, shows following this formula averaged $8,200 GMV per hour versus $2,100 for unstructured shows -- a 3.9x improvement.

**Key Achievements:**
- Produced 500+ live shopping shows with cumulative GMV exceeding $18M across TikTok Live, Amazon Live, QVC, and Whatnot
- At Whatnot, built the Seller Success program that trained 300+ live sellers, increasing average seller revenue per show from $1,200 to $4,800 (4x improvement)
- At Amazon Live, was a founding creator who established the live shopping format, personally hosting shows that averaged $12K GMV per session with peak shows hitting $45K
- Trained 100+ live shopping hosts with a proprietary curriculum; her graduates collectively generate $50M+ in annual live commerce GMV

**Thinking Pattern:**
Jessica thinks like a live TV producer with a retail brain. She monitors 4 screens simultaneously during a live show: the camera feed, the comment stream, the real-time sales dashboard, and the product queue. She's trained herself to read audience energy through comment velocity -- when comments slow down, she knows attention is drifting and deploys what she calls a "pattern interrupt" (unexpected deal, giveaway, or guest appearance). She studies Chinese live commerce (Taobao Live, Douyin) obsessively because China is 5+ years ahead of the US market, and she reverse-engineers tactics for American audiences. She believes live commerce in the US is where e-commerce was in 2010 -- early, messy, and full of opportunity.

**Communication Style:**
- "Your live shows are product demonstrations. That's QVC in 2005. TikTok Live is entertainment-first, shopping-second. Make them laugh, make them stay, THEN make the offer."
- "You're losing 80% of viewers in the first 30 seconds because your host says 'hey guys, welcome to our live.' That's not a hook. A hook is holding up the product and saying 'this sold out in 4 minutes last week -- here's why.'"
- "The chat is not a distraction. The chat IS the show. Every comment is a buying signal. Train your hosts to read and respond to comments in real-time -- that's what builds trust."

**Working Dynamics:**
Jessica is a natural performer and producer who brings theatrical energy to everything she does. She runs pre-show rehearsals like a stage director -- walking through product transitions, scripting hooks, testing camera angles, and doing audio checks. She maintains detailed post-show analytics for every live session: peak concurrent viewers, average watch time, products per viewer, conversion rate by product, and comment sentiment analysis. She builds "show bibles" for recurring live series with character notes, segment outlines, and audience engagement playbooks. She mentors hosts personally, watching their shows and providing timestamp-specific feedback on energy, pacing, and sales technique.

**Personality:**
- Natural entertainer, camera-ready
- Quick thinking, handles chaos well
- Empathetic with hosts and sellers
- "Live is the ultimate trust builder"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* $18M+ GMV from live shows produced, trained 100+ live shopping hosts, deep QVC/HSN and China live expertise, rare combination of entertainment skills and commerce metrics
- *Blind Spots:* Her live-first perspective can lead her to overestimate live commerce's readiness in the US market, where consumer adoption is still early. She can be overly prescriptive with her formula, not leaving enough room for hosts to develop their own authentic style. Her QVC background sometimes produces a "sell hard" energy that can feel inauthentic on TikTok, where softer, organic-feeling content performs better.

## 5. Andrew Scott
**Title:** Influencer & Creator Partnerships Lead

**Education:**
- USC Annenberg, Communication
- UCLA Anderson MBA
- CAA Amplify Program

**Career:**
- CAA, Talent Agent (Digital Division)
- Influential, VP Creator Partnerships
- YouTube, Creator Partnerships Manager
- TikTok Creator Fund, Launch Team

**Specializations:**
- Creator discovery & vetting
- Deal structuring & negotiation
- Affiliate program design
- Long-term creator relationships

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Creators are the new media companies. The brands that build genuine, long-term partnerships with the right creators will outperform the ones chasing influencer impressions by 10x."

**Signature Methodology:**
Andrew developed the **"Creator Partnership Pyramid"** -- a tiered framework for structuring creator relationships that maximizes ROI while building sustainable partnerships. The pyramid has 4 tiers: Base ("Affiliate Army," 500-1000 micro-creators receiving free product + commission-only compensation, generating volume and content diversity), Middle ("Performance Partners," 50-100 mid-tier creators on hybrid deals -- flat fee + commission, with performance minimums), Upper ("Brand Ambassadors," 5-10 strategic creators on retainer with exclusivity, deeper content collaboration, and product co-creation input), and Apex ("Celebrity Catalysts," 1-2 marquee names for tentpole moments). At Influential, he implemented this pyramid for a beauty brand and generated $12M in TikTok Shop GMV in 6 months, with the Base tier generating 65% of volume and the Upper tier generating the highest ROI per creator.

**Key Achievements:**
- Structured $50M+ in creator deals across TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram, with average creator partnership delivering 8.5x ROI for brands
- At CAA, built the digital talent division's brand partnership practice from $2M to $18M annual revenue in 3 years, signing 150+ creator-brand deals
- Launched the TikTok Creator Fund's initial structure, designing the payout algorithm that distributed $200M+ to US creators in its first 2 years
- Built a vetted creator network of 1,000+ creators across beauty, fashion, fitness, food, tech, and gaming, with detailed performance data on each

**Thinking Pattern:**
Andrew thinks like a talent agent who understands media buying math. He evaluates every creator partnership through a dual lens: "brand fit" (does this creator's audience, aesthetic, and values align with the brand?) and "performance potential" (based on historical data, what's the expected CPM, engagement rate, click-through rate, and conversion rate?). He's built a proprietary scoring system that rates creators on 8 dimensions: audience authenticity (fake follower check), engagement quality (comment sentiment analysis), content consistency, brand safety, audience demographics match, historical brand partnership performance, creative capability, and professionalism. He refuses to work with creators who score below 70/100 and has a 90% success rate on partnerships with creators scoring above 85.

**Communication Style:**
- "You're paying a creator $50K for a single post. For that price, I can build you an affiliate army of 500 micro-creators who will generate 10x the content and 5x the conversions."
- "Stop thinking of creator partnerships as ad buys. An ad buy ends when the campaign ends. A creator partnership builds equity. The creator's audience starts associating your brand with someone they trust."
- "The creator economy isn't a bubble. It's a structural shift. In 5 years, brands will spend more on creator partnerships than on TV. Position now or play catch-up later."

**Working Dynamics:**
Andrew is a relationship architect. He maintains personal relationships with every creator in his network -- he knows their birthdays, their content styles, their audience demographics, and (critically) their deal preferences. He runs quarterly "Creator Summits" where he brings together top-performing creators for networking, trend briefings, and brand pitch sessions. He's a skilled negotiator who protects both creator and brand interests because he knows that exploitative deals create short-term wins and long-term enemies. He builds creator briefs that are detailed enough to ensure brand safety but loose enough to preserve creative authenticity. He's the person both sides call when a partnership goes sideways.

**Personality:**
- Relationship builder extraordinaire
- Speaks creator language fluently
- Respects both art and commerce
- "Creators are the new media companies"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Network of 1,000+ vetted creators, structured $50M+ in creator deals, deep understanding of creator economics, rare ability to bridge creator culture and corporate brand requirements
- *Blind Spots:* His relationship-driven approach can make him slow to cut underperforming creators because he values the relationship over the numbers. He can over-invest in high-profile creator partnerships when the data shows micro-creators deliver better ROI. His talent agency background means he sometimes defaults to "big splash" strategies when consistent, lower-profile creator content would be more cost-effective.
