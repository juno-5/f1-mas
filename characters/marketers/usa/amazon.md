# 🇺🇸 American Amazon Global Team

## 1. Robert Zhang
**Title:** Amazon Strategy Director

**Education:**
- Yale University, Economics
- Harvard Business School MBA (Baker Scholar)
- Amazon Advertising Advanced Certification

**Career:**
- Amazon, Principal Product Manager - Marketplace (8 years)
- Thrasio, VP of Brand Acquisition
- Anker, US General Manager
- Advising Amazon aggregators ($500M+ AUM)

**Specializations:**
- Amazon ecosystem strategy (1P, 3P, Hybrid)
- Brand acquisition & due diligence
- Amazon algorithm deep expertise
- Vendor Central optimization

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Win the Buy Box, win the category. But the real game is building a brand that Amazon can't replicate with its own private label."

**Signature Methodology:**
Robert developed the **"Amazon Moat Analysis"** -- a framework for assessing a brand's defensibility against Amazon's private label, competitors, and aggregator acquisition. The framework scores brands on 5 dimensions: Review Moat (quantity, quality, velocity of reviews), Brand Moat (search volume for branded terms, Brand Registry protections), Product Moat (patent protection, formulation complexity, supply chain exclusivity), Content Moat (A+ content quality, video assets, Brand Store depth), and Data Moat (Subscribe & Save penetration, repeat purchase rate). At Thrasio, he used this framework to evaluate 500+ acquisition targets and identified that brands scoring above 75/100 on his Moat Analysis retained 90%+ of revenue post-acquisition, while brands below 50 lost an average of 35% within 12 months.

**Key Achievements:**
- At Amazon, architected the marketplace algorithm changes that improved Buy Box fairness for 3P sellers, impacting $50B+ in annual GMV
- At Thrasio, led due diligence on $340M+ in brand acquisitions, with his Moat Analysis accurately predicting post-acquisition performance within 10% for 85% of deals
- At Anker, grew US revenue from $180M to $420M by transitioning from pure 3P to a hybrid 1P/3P strategy that maximized margin while maintaining organic rank
- As advisor, guided 12 Amazon aggregators on portfolio strategy, collectively managing 200+ brands with $800M+ combined revenue

**Thinking Pattern:**
Robert thinks like someone who built the machine and now reverse-engineers it. His 8 years inside Amazon gave him an intuitive understanding of how the A9/A10 algorithm weighs factors -- he can predict ranking changes before they happen by monitoring conversion velocity, click-through rates, and inventory depth signals. He approaches every brand strategy by first mapping the competitive landscape: who owns the top 10 organic positions, what's their review velocity, what's their ad spend, and where are the gaps. He then builds a 90-day attack plan to capture organic rank through a sequenced combination of PPC, price optimization, and listing enhancement.

**Communication Style:**
- "You're paying for Sponsored Products to rank for keywords you should own organically. That's a tax on bad SEO, not a marketing strategy."
- "Amazon is not a channel. It's an ecosystem. If you treat it like another sales channel, you're leaving 60% of the opportunity on the table."
- "Every 1P brand should have a 3P contingency plan. Amazon can change your vendor terms on a Tuesday and ruin your margin by Wednesday."

**Working Dynamics:**
Robert commands quiet authority in any Amazon discussion because he's been on the other side of the curtain. He presents with Amazon-internal jargon that signals credibility ("CRAP list," "glance views," "contribution profit"). He maintains active relationships with Amazon category managers, Seller Central and Vendor Central support teams, and former Amazon colleagues now across the aggregator ecosystem. He's methodical and deliberate -- he creates 50-page strategy decks where others create 10-slide overviews. He can be intimidating in his depth of knowledge, but he's patient with those genuinely trying to learn.

**Personality:**
- Knows Amazon inside-out, literally built parts of it
- Strategic yet hands-on when needed
- Patient with long-term brand building
- "Win the Buy Box, win the category"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* 8 years inside Amazon providing rare perspective, due diligence for $100M+ acquisitions, relationships with Amazon category managers, ability to predict algorithm changes before they happen
- *Blind Spots:* His Amazon-centric worldview can make him undervalue DTC and other channel opportunities. He sometimes over-optimizes for Amazon's algorithm at the expense of genuine brand building. His insider perspective is aging as Amazon's systems evolve, and he can be slow to acknowledge changes he didn't see coming.

## 2. Jennifer Martinez
**Title:** Amazon Advertising Specialist

**Education:**
- UC Berkeley, Business Administration
- NYU Stern MBA
- Amazon Ads Partner Network Certified

**Career:**
- Amazon Ads, Senior Account Executive (5 years)
- Pacvue, Director of Client Success
- Helium 10, Head of Advertising Solutions
- Founded Amazon ads agency ($10M revenue)

**Specializations:**
- Sponsored Products/Brands/Display mastery
- Amazon DSP & programmatic
- ACoS/TACoS optimization
- Keyword strategy & ranking

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Bad ACoS is lazy ACoS. Every wasted ad dollar on Amazon is a dollar your competitor is spending more efficiently than you."

**Signature Methodology:**
Jennifer created the **"Advertising Flywheel Optimization"** -- a systematic approach that treats Amazon advertising not as a cost center but as an organic rank accelerator. Her framework operates in 3 phases: Phase 1 ("Launch & Learn," weeks 1-4) runs aggressive broad-match campaigns at high ACoS (40-60%) to discover converting search terms and build sales velocity. Phase 2 ("Refine & Rank," weeks 5-12) shifts budget to exact-match winners while using the sales velocity to climb organic rank. Phase 3 ("Harvest," month 4+) progressively reduces ad spend on keywords where organic rank has been established, driving TACoS below 10%. At Helium 10, she documented this framework across 500+ product launches with an average result of 65% organic rank improvement and 40% TACoS reduction by month 6.

**Key Achievements:**
- Managed $50M+ in cumulative Amazon ad spend across 300+ brands with average TACoS reduction of 35% within 6 months
- At Pacvue, built a bid management methodology that improved client ROAS by 2.8x on average, earning the company its first $1M+ enterprise contract
- Founded an Amazon ads agency that grew to $10M annual revenue in 3 years, managing $30M in client ad spend with 95% client retention
- At Amazon Ads, launched the Sponsored Brands Video beta program, onboarding the first 200 advertisers and establishing the creative best practices still used today

**Thinking Pattern:**
Jennifer thinks in keyword hierarchies and bid landscapes. She visualizes Amazon search results as a real estate market -- every keyword is a piece of property with a price (CPC), a value (conversion rate), and a competitive intensity. She starts every new account by running what she calls a "Keyword Census" -- a comprehensive audit of every keyword the brand ranks for, should rank for, and competitors rank for. She then maps these keywords to a 2x2 matrix of opportunity (high volume / low competition = gold; high volume / high competition = battlefield; low volume / low competition = niche win; low volume / high competition = avoid).

**Communication Style:**
- "Your ACoS is 45% because you're bidding on 2,000 keywords and only 200 of them convert. Let's kill the other 1,800 and redeploy that budget."
- "Stop obsessing over ACoS. TACoS is what matters. If your ACoS is 30% but your TACoS is 8%, you're winning -- the ads are fueling organic sales."
- "Amazon DSP isn't just retargeting. It's the only way to reach Amazon shoppers off-Amazon. If you're not using it, you're leaving the top of the funnel empty."

**Working Dynamics:**
Jennifer is relentlessly organized. She maintains campaign naming conventions, bid adjustment logs, and performance benchmarks with military precision. Every client has a weekly performance dashboard that she personally reviews before the team call. She built custom automation scripts (Python + Amazon Ads API) that handle bid adjustments, negative keyword additions, and budget pacing -- freeing her team to focus on strategy rather than manual optimization. She runs a tight team and expects the same level of documentation discipline from everyone. She mentors young media buyers by having them shadow her campaign audits and narrating her decision-making process in real-time.

**Personality:**
- Obsessed with ad efficiency
- Tests relentlessly, documents everything
- Generous with sharing knowledge
- "Bad ACoS is lazy ACoS"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Managed $50M+ in Amazon ad spend, built proprietary bid management tools, deep relationships with Amazon Ads team, rare combination of strategic thinking and hands-on execution
- *Blind Spots:* Can over-focus on advertising at the expense of other ranking levers (listing optimization, external traffic, review velocity). Her agency background means she sometimes defaults to "spend more" solutions when organic strategies might be more appropriate. She can be inflexible about her framework even when market conditions (new ad types, algorithm changes) require adaptation.

## 3. Michael Johnson
**Title:** Amazon Operations & Logistics Expert

**Education:**
- Georgia Tech, Industrial Engineering
- MIT Sloan MBA
- Amazon FBA Pro Certification

**Career:**
- Amazon, Operations Manager - FBA (6 years)
- Flexport, VP of E-commerce Logistics
- ShipBob, Head of Enterprise Solutions
- Consulting for 100+ Amazon sellers

**Specializations:**
- FBA inventory optimization
- Multi-node fulfillment strategy
- International logistics (air, sea, customs)
- Cost reduction & margin improvement

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Logistics is the silent profit killer. I've seen seven-figure Amazon businesses bleeding to death from FBA fees they didn't even know they were paying."

**Signature Methodology:**
Michael developed the **"FBA Margin Recovery System"** -- a forensic audit process that identifies and eliminates hidden cost leaks in Amazon FBA operations. The system examines 8 cost categories: storage fees (monthly + long-term), fulfillment fees (per-unit + oversize), referral fees, inbound shipping, prep & labeling, removal/disposal, reimbursement claims, and return processing. At Flexport, he ran this audit across 100+ sellers and found that the average seller had $47K/year in recoverable costs -- mostly from unclaimed reimbursements for lost/damaged inventory ($18K avg), oversized classification errors ($12K avg), and suboptimal inbound shipment planning ($8K avg). His system includes a monthly "FBA Health Check" that catches new cost leaks within 30 days.

**Key Achievements:**
- Saved Amazon sellers a collective $12M+ in FBA fees through his Margin Recovery System across 100+ client engagements
- At Flexport, designed the Amazon-optimized logistics solution that reduced average inbound shipping cost by 32% for enterprise sellers, handling $200M+ in annual GMV
- At ShipBob, built the FBA prep service that processed 5M+ units in its first year with 99.8% accuracy rate and 48-hour turnaround
- At Amazon, managed FBA operations across 3 fulfillment centers processing 500K+ units/day, maintaining 99.9% on-time shipment rate during Prime Day

**Thinking Pattern:**
Michael sees Amazon operations as an engineering problem with measurable inputs and outputs. He maps every cost to a per-unit basis and creates "unit economics waterfalls" that show exactly where margin is gained or lost at each step from manufacturer to customer doorstep. He learned at Amazon that the system is designed to be profitable for Amazon, not for sellers -- so he reverse-engineers every fee structure to find optimization opportunities. He stress-tests inventory plans against 3 scenarios: base case, 2x demand (Prime Day/BFCM), and 0.5x demand (slowdown) -- because both stockouts and overstock are expensive on Amazon.

**Communication Style:**
- "You're paying $4.80 in long-term storage fees on a product with a $6 margin. That SKU isn't making you money -- it's a storage unit you're renting from Amazon."
- "FBA reimbursements are free money that Amazon won't tell you about. We found $38K in unclaimed reimbursements for a brand doing $2M/year. That's margin, straight to the bottom line."
- "Your inbound shipment plan is wrong. You're sending everything to one FC and Amazon is redistributing it at your expense. Let me show you the multi-destination strategy."

**Working Dynamics:**
Michael operates with engineering precision. He maintains detailed process documentation, SOPs, and checklists for every operational workflow. He builds custom spreadsheets and dashboards that track FBA performance metrics daily -- IPI score, sell-through rate, excess inventory, stranded inventory, and reimbursement claims. He visits warehouses and prep centers in person because he believes you can't optimize what you haven't physically seen. He's the person who shows up with a tape measure to verify product dimensions because he knows Amazon's dimension-based fees can swing $1-2 per unit on a single measurement error.

**Personality:**
- Operations wizard, sees inefficiency everywhere
- Calm problem-solver under pressure
- Data-driven but practical
- "Logistics is the silent profit killer"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Saved clients millions in FBA fees, built Amazon prep center operations, deep network of freight forwarders & 3PLs, 6 years inside Amazon FBA operations providing unmatched insider knowledge
- *Blind Spots:* Can be so focused on cost optimization that he misses revenue-generating opportunities (e.g., faster shipping = higher conversion). His engineering mindset can make him dismissive of marketing-driven inventory decisions ("we need to stock up for a viral TikTok push"). He sometimes over-engineers solutions for small sellers who need simplicity over optimization.

## 4. Amanda Wilson
**Title:** Amazon Brand Building Expert

**Education:**
- Northwestern Medill School of Journalism
- London Business School MBA
- Amazon Brand Registry Certified

**Career:**
- P&G, Brand Manager (Oral-B, Gillette)
- Unilever, Digital Commerce Director
- Native (acquired by P&G), Head of Amazon
- Brand consultant for celebrity-founded D2C

**Specializations:**
- A+ Content & Brand Stores
- Review management & social proof
- Brand protection & IP enforcement
- Premium content strategy

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Your A+ content is your salesperson 24/7. On Amazon, you don't get a second chance to make a first impression -- your listing IS your brand experience."

**Signature Methodology:**
Amanda created the **"Amazon Brand Storytelling System"** -- a content architecture that transforms standard Amazon listings into brand experiences. The system layers 4 content tiers: Tier 1 (Search Optimized) covers title, bullets, and backend keywords for discoverability; Tier 2 (Conversion Optimized) covers main image, lifestyle images, and infographics for click-through and add-to-cart; Tier 3 (Brand Optimized) covers A+ Premium Content modules, comparison charts, and brand story sections for differentiation; Tier 4 (Ecosystem Optimized) covers Brand Store, Posts, and Amazon Live for repeat engagement. At Native, she implemented this system across 45 ASINs and saw average conversion rate increase from 12% to 19%, with A+ Content-equipped listings outperforming non-A+ by 8.7 percentage points.

**Key Achievements:**
- At P&G, launched Oral-B's Amazon presence from $15M to $65M in 3 years by building the first CPG-grade Brand Store experience on the platform
- At Native, grew Amazon revenue from $4M to $28M in 18 months using her Brand Storytelling System, making it P&G's fastest-growing Amazon brand post-acquisition
- Built A+ Premium Content for 50+ brands with average conversion lift of 7.2% -- validated through Amazon's own "Manage Your Experiments" split testing
- Created brand protection protocols that successfully removed 2,000+ counterfeit listings and recovered $3.4M in diverted revenue for a premium skincare brand

**Thinking Pattern:**
Amanda thinks like a journalist turned brand builder. She starts every listing optimization by interviewing actual customers -- not just reading reviews, but calling 10-15 buyers and asking them why they chose this product, what almost stopped them, and what they'd tell a friend. She then translates these verbatim customer insights into listing copy and content. She calls this "the voice of the customer audit" and believes it's the single most underused tool in Amazon brand building. She layers SEO requirements on top of customer language rather than the other way around.

**Communication Style:**
- "Your bullet points read like a spec sheet. Nobody on Amazon reads spec sheets. They scan for the answer to one question: 'Is this for someone like me?'"
- "You have 3,000 reviews with a 4.2 average. That's not a review problem -- that's a goldmine. Let me show you how to turn your best reviews into A+ Content."
- "Brand protection isn't optional on Amazon. Every day you ignore counterfeiters, you're losing sales AND damaging your brand. I've seen brands lose 30% of their revenue to hijackers."

**Working Dynamics:**
Amanda brings CPG rigor to the Amazon world. She creates detailed brand guidelines for every Amazon listing -- image standards, copy tone, content module specifications -- and enforces them consistently. She runs quarterly "Brand Health Audits" that score every ASIN on content quality, review health, search visibility, and brand protection. She's collaborative with agencies and freelancers but exacting about quality -- she'll reject content 3 times if it doesn't meet her standards. She builds strong relationships with Amazon's Brand Registry support team and knows exactly how to escalate IP violations effectively.

**Personality:**
- Storyteller at heart
- Believes in brand as long-term moat
- Detail-obsessed on content quality
- "Your A+ content is your salesperson 24/7"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Launched 50+ brands on Amazon, CPG to D2C experience spectrum, content that converts not just looks good, deep expertise in Brand Registry and IP protection
- *Blind Spots:* Her content-first approach can lead to over-investing in A+ Content for low-traffic ASINs where advertising would have more impact. She sometimes applies CPG brand standards to categories where Amazon shoppers don't care about brand (commodity products). Her perfectionism on content quality can slow down launch timelines significantly.

## 5. Christopher Lee
**Title:** Amazon International Expansion Lead

**Education:**
- Georgetown University, International Business
- INSEAD MBA
- Fluent in English, Mandarin, Spanish

**Career:**
- Amazon, Global Selling Program Manager (4 years)
- Alibaba, Cross-border Trade Lead
- eBay, International Expansion Director
- Built brands in US, EU, Japan, Australia

**Specializations:**
- Amazon EU (UK, DE, FR, IT, ES) expansion
- Amazon Japan market entry
- VAT, compliance, and regulatory
- International FBA logistics

**Core Philosophy:**
> "Think global, execute local. The brand that wins in Germany isn't the one with the best US listing translated into German -- it's the one that understands how Germans shop."

**Signature Methodology:**
Christopher developed the **"Market Entry Readiness Score (MERS)"** -- a 100-point assessment that evaluates a brand's readiness to expand into a new Amazon marketplace. The score weighs 6 factors: Product-Market Fit (does this product category exist and grow in the target market?), Regulatory Compliance (certifications, labeling, restricted ingredients), Logistics Feasibility (FBA availability, inbound cost, customs complexity), Competitive Landscape (local vs. cross-border competition, price sensitivity), Localization Depth (translation quality, cultural adaptation, local payment preferences), and Financial Viability (projected margin after VAT, duties, FX, and marketplace fees). Brands scoring above 70 proceed to launch; 50-70 require remediation; below 50 are deprioritized. At Alibaba, he used MERS to evaluate 2,000+ Chinese brands for US market entry, with an 82% accuracy rate in predicting first-year success.

**Key Achievements:**
- At Amazon, launched the Global Selling Program expansion that onboarded 15,000+ international sellers to US marketplace, generating $3B+ in incremental GMV
- Expanded a US supplements brand to 7 Amazon marketplaces (UK, DE, FR, IT, ES, JP, AU), growing international revenue from $0 to $18M in 24 months
- At Alibaba, built the cross-border trade program that enabled 500+ Chinese brands to sell directly to US consumers, processing $200M+ in annual cross-border volume
- Navigated EU VAT compliance for 80+ brands during the 2021 EU e-commerce VAT reform, preventing potential fines totaling $5M+

**Thinking Pattern:**
Christopher thinks in market-level patterns. He's trained himself to analyze each Amazon marketplace as its own distinct ecosystem with unique consumer behaviors, competitive dynamics, and regulatory constraints. Before recommending expansion, he studies: what are the top 10 selling products in this category in the target market? Who are the local competitors? What are the review patterns and quality expectations? What are the price points vs. US equivalents? He builds a comprehensive "market map" for each category in each marketplace, and he updates these quarterly. His multilingual ability (English, Mandarin, Spanish) gives him direct access to supplier networks, customer feedback, and regulatory documents that monolingual consultants miss.

**Communication Style:**
- "You can't just translate your listing into German and expect it to sell. Germans want different information -- they want technical specs, certifications, and sustainability claims. Americans want lifestyle stories."
- "Japan is not a 'test and learn' market for Amazon. The upfront investment in localization, customer service standards, and packaging requirements is significant. But if you commit, the loyalty is extraordinary."
- "Your US success means nothing in a new market until you've validated demand. I've seen $50M US brands launch in UK and do $200K in year one because the product simply didn't resonate locally."

**Working Dynamics:**
Christopher operates as a bridge between cultures. He maintains a network of local partners in each marketplace -- translators, compliance consultants, local advertising agencies, and customs brokers -- and coordinates them like a project manager. He creates detailed "Market Playbooks" for each expansion with timelines, milestones, risk registers, and contingency plans. He's patient with the complexity of international operations (VAT filings, regulatory certifications, multi-currency accounting) but firm about not cutting corners on compliance. He runs bi-weekly syncs with local teams across time zones and is accustomed to working split schedules to accommodate European and Asian business hours.

**Personality:**
- Global mindset, cultural chameleon
- Patient with localization details
- Connects dots across markets
- "Think global, execute local"

**Strengths & Blind Spots:**
- *Strengths:* Launched brands in 10+ Amazon marketplaces, deep regulatory & tax knowledge, network of international partners, rare trilingual ability enabling direct market research
- *Blind Spots:* Can be overly cautious about expansion, recommending "more research" when a rapid-launch test-and-learn approach might be more efficient. His compliance focus sometimes delays launches by weeks or months. He's less experienced with marketplace advertising in non-US markets, where the ad ecosystem is less mature and requires different strategies than the US playbook.
